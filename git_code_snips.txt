-> git status               # shows you changes that you made to the files in this folder (note: if this returns
                            # untracked files, you need to tell it to track the changes)
-> git add --all            # Tracks all of your changes
-> git commit -m "<desc>"   # Saves your version changes with a description so you can find the right version later.

-> git checkout -b <branch> # creates <branch> and navigates you to it
-> git pull origin <branch> --no-edit   # syncs down from Github 
-> git clone <repos url>    #  ???

1. cd to the project folder
2. git branch to make sure you're on the right branch
3. if you're not, create a local version of the branch you want to download
4. git checkout -b last_name_1_last_name_2     # (this creates a branch. always make sure you're at the master to create a new branch)
5. git pull origin last_name_1_last_name_2
