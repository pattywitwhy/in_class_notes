# Questions for Monday 2/4


2. How to do the bonus from w04d01: `Make it so a user can create new images for a given product`

3. How to get my subtotal, tax, and total to display on the netlify account?

4. Is it okay that I changed full name to `(first_name || "") + " " + (middle_name || "") + " " + (last_name || "")` to fix my `nil` name error? How else can I resolve this?
  * Same question with `turning_japanese`: `"+81" + " " + (phone_number || "")`

  * I think the problem is id 1006-1008. How could I have found that out without knowing. where first_name = null or last_name = null, I'm guessing?

5. How can I delete all the groups and do it the better way we did in class? I've got tons of duplicates.
