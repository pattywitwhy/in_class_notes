## Example in Mini Capstone

Don't follow along with this, Josh is going to revert when he's done.

We're going to modify the order controller from yesterday. I assume that we're going to be making a bunch of changes, and then Rails is going to do it automatically, and that's why Josh doesn't want us to make these modifications. 

The controller should deal with the logic of "which view should I render?", not the inner workings of what a model is. So we're going to try and clean up the controller by putting the calculations into the model.

```ruby
class Api::OrdersController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @orders = Order.all 
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
    
  end

  def create
    product = Product.find(params[:product_id])

    @order = Order.new(
                      user_id: current_user.id,
                      product_id: params[:product_id],
                      quantity: params[:quantity]
                      subtotal: calculated_subtotal
                      tax: calculated_tax
                      total: calculated_subtotal + calculated_tax
                      )
    
    # @order.calculate_subtotal
    # @order.calculate_tax
    # @order.calculate_total   # Order matters here, because tax depends on subtotal being calculated, and total dependson both subtotal and tax. So we're going to write one more method to make our code less brittle: calculate totals.
    # Now we just have to run that one method

    @order.calculate_totals
    
    if @order.save
      render 'show.json.jbuilder'
    else
      render json: { errors: @order.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  def show
    @orders = order.find(params[:id])
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end

  
end
```

In the model `order.rb`:


```ruby

def calculate_subtotal
  self.subtotal = quantity * product.price
end

def calculate_tax
  self.tax = subtotal * 0.09
end

def calculate_total
  self.total = tax + subtotal 
end

def calculate_totals
  calculated_subtotal
  calculate_tax
  calculate_total
end

```

## Authorization: Granting Access to Different Users

### Starting with our Mini-Capstone

We want to restrict who can change or delete a product. Right now any user logged in can do things like: change the price, add items, delete items... which is not what you want. We want to restrict actions like that to employees, admins, etc.

Trying to create three levels:

1. Guests - can view products.
2. Customers - Can view and purchase products.
3. Admins - Can add, update, delete products.

We're going to start by adding customers to our mini-capstone, who can see their orders, and **only** their orders. When you call an association method, you must have a single object to call that association on.

In the orders controller `products_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class Api::OrdersController < ApplicationController
before_action :authenticate_user      ## This happens BEFORE any action is taken. Woo.
# If you wanted before_action to ONLY run on index and create, you could use :autnenticate_user, except: [:index, :create]
# If you wanted before_action to run on every action EXCEPT index and create, use :autnenticate_user, only: [:index, :create]


  def index

      @orders = current_user.orders
      render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end
    
  end
  def create
    product = Product.find(params[:product_id])
    calculated_subtotal = params[:quantity].to_i * product.price
    calculated_tax = calculated_subtotal * 0.09

    @order = Order.new(
                      user_id: current_user.id,
                      product_id: params[:product_id],
                      quantity: params[:quantity],
                      subtotal: calculated_subtotal,
                      tax: calculated_tax,
                      total: calculated_subtotal + calculated_tax
                      )
    
    if @order.save
      render 'show.json.jbuilder'
    else
      render json: { errors: @order.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  def show
    @order = Order.find(current_user.id)
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

Next we're going to add an admin attribute to our users.

```bash
rails g migration AddAdminToUsers admin:boolean
```

Add the default = false to your migration file so users are NOT admins by default

```ruby
class AddAdminToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    add_column :users, :admin, :boolean, default: false
  end
end
```

Put this in your application_controller.rb

```ruby
def authenticate_admin
  unless current_user && current_user.admin?
    render json: {}, status: :unauthorized
  end
end

```

Then add authenticate_admin to everything in your products controller except index and show, by adding this line:

```ruby
before_action :authenticate_admin, except: [:index, :show]
```

Now we're going to update our show action in views > api > products > show. Remove `if current user` conditional statement if it was in there. We fixed this with the authentication. So, as of now, there's only one line in the show: `json.partial! @product, partial: "product", as: :product`

### New Association: Has Many Through 

Let's say we want to add product categories to our mini capstone. But each product falls into multiple categories: e.g., shoes & business casual. We're actually going to add a third table that will track the associations. A **join table**. This is a many-to-many relationship. You can think of it as the place where products and categories meet. By analogy, we're documenting the handshakes between other tables. The associations. 

"The join table documents the interactions betweent two or more tables."

The join table should **never** be called a join table! A good go-to is just smashing the two table names together. So, we we have products and cateories, our join table can be called ProductCategories. Another example: McDonalds and Customers would be McDonalsCustomers.

To join 

```ruby

```

### Adding a Join Table

```bash
rails g model ProductCategory product_id:integer category_id:integer
rails g model Category name
# Check the migration files for accuracy
rake db:migrate
```

Now we're going to open up three models

`product.rb`:

```ruby
has_many :product_categories
has_many :categories, through: :product_categories
```

`product_category.rb`:

```ruby
class ProductCategory < ApplicationRecord
belongs_to :product
belongs_to :category
end
```

`category.rb`:

```ruby
class Category < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :product_categories
  has_many :products, through: :product_categories
end
```

```bash

```


```ruby

```
