# W02D01 - Ruby on Rails

Rails is great for building websites & web apps quickly, but it's not good for much else. You can build about 80% of your web app in a few lines of code, but you may spend years writing the last 20%.

Every time you interact with a website, you always (at least) go through the same four steps:

1. Web request
2. Routing action (?)
3. Controller action
4. Web response

We're going to go through these steps today by creating our own sample web app. 

### Creating a Sample Web APP

First, type the following in to the terminal:

```bash
rails new sample_app
cd sample_app
rails generate controller api/example_pages
rake db:create
rails server
```

Second, navigate to your browser, and go to `localhost:3000` in the url bar. As long as you're running the server, you should be able to access your web app by following this step. To exit the server, you shoud NOT just exit the terminal running the server. Use `ctrl + c` to exit.

Third, use sublime to open `sample_app/config/routes.rb` and `sample_app/app/controllers/api/example_pages_controller.rb`.

3a. In `routes.rb`, type the following: 

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/hello_url" => 'api/example_pages#hello_action'
  get "/second_url" => 'api/example_pages#second_action'
  get "/current_time" => 'api/example_pages#time_action'
end
```

Routes defines the urls that will be used to acess your pages. You'll be able to acess each using the localhost domain, and the url you specify in `routes.rb`. The # in the righthand side of the url definitions should point to a method, that you will define in `example_pages_controller.rb`.

Note that `hello_action`, `second_action`, and `time_action` are distinct pages.

3b. In `example_pages_controller.rb`:

```ruby 
class Api::ExamplePagesController < ApplicationController
  def hello_action
    render json: {message: "hello"}
  end

  def second_action
    render json: ["this", "is", "the", "second", "action"]
  end

  def time_action
    @time = Time.now.strftime("%l:%M %p")
    render json: {current_time: @time}
  end
end
```

Now, if you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/hello_url`, you'll see this output:

```json
{
"message": "hello"
}
```

Note: you can only have one render line per action. 

If you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/hello_url`, you'll find:

```json
[
"this",
"is",
"the",
"second",
"action"
]
```

We also built a time app. When we navigate to `http://localhost:3000/hello_url`, it will politely give us the time. If we didn't add the `.strftime("%l:%M %p")` to the end of `Time.now`, the formatting would've looked like this. 

```json
{
"current_time": "2019-01-14T10:47:27.007-06:00"
}
```

But since we used `https://foragoodstrftime.com/`'s formatting, it's going to look great, like this:

```json
{
"current_time": "10:51 AM"
}
```

Which is much more readable. Hooray!

Now we're going to add one more step to our 4 initial steps:

1. Web request
2. API Route
3. API Controller
4. API view
5. Web response

We're also going to modify `example_pages_controller.rb`. In this example, we used render in this file for our output. In practice, you would only do this if there is only a single line of code. We're going to use another file for this purpose.


In `sample_app/app/views/api/example_pages`, create a new file `time_view.json.jbuilder`, and add this code:

```ruby
json.current_time @time
```

*** __To pass information from a controller to a view, the data must be stored in an instance variable.__ ***

You will be using jbuilder and the views folder from here forward.

Now, when we go to `localhost:3000/current_time`, we get this lovely reponse:

```
{
"current_time": "11:19 AM"
}
```



• Note: Jbuilder uses ruby syntax.


### Another example:

In the terminal...

```bash
cd ~/actualize
rails new fortune_app
cd fortune_app
subl .
rails generate controller api/my_examples
rake db:create
rails server
```

__Note: If you don't name your rails controller plural (e.g., `rails generate controller api/my_examples`), your application *will break* later on.__

Files you will modify:
```
fortune/config/routes.rb
fortune/app/controllers/api/my_examples_controller
fortune/app/views/api/my_examples/fortune_view.json.jbuilder
```

In `fortune/config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/fortune_url" => 'api/my_examples#fortune_action'
end
```

In `fortune/app/controllers/api/my_examples_controller`:


```ruby 
class Api::ExamplePagesController < ApplicationController
  def fortune_action
    possible_fortunes = [
                          "you will be an 8th grader that will soon be a full-time business man", 
                          "you will be Vincent Adultman, and you do a really good business.", 
                          "you will soon adopt 3 orphan children, even though you are a single, adult horse."
                        ]
    @fortune = possible_fortunes[ rand(possible_fortunes.length) ]
    # @fortune = "I look into the mystics sands of time, and I see " + possible_fortunes.sample
    # @fortune = possible_fortunes.sample  # This would also work.
    render 'fortune_view.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

In `fortune/app/views/api/my_examples/fortune_view.json.jbuilder`:

```
json.fortune @fortune
```

If you go to `localhost:3000/fortune_url`, you'll see the correct page.



### Let's do another page

Files you will modify:
```
fortune/config/routes.rb
fortune/app/controllers/api/my_examples_controller
fortune/app/views/api/my_examples/lotto_view.json.jbuilder
```

In `fortune/config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/fortune_url" => 'api/my_examples#fortune_action'
  get '/lotto_url' => 'api/my_examples#lotto_action'
end
```

In `fortune/app/controllers/api/my_examples_controller`:


```ruby 
class Api::ExamplePagesController < ApplicationController
  def fortune_action
    possible_fortunes = [
                          "You are an 8th grader that will soon be a full-time business man", 
                          "You are Vincent Adultman, and you do a really good business.", 
                          "You will soon adopt 3 orphan children, even though you are a single, adult horse."
                        ]
    @fortune = "I look into the mystics sands of time, and I see " + possible_fortunes.sample
    render 'fortune_view.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def lotto_action
    # @lotto_numbers = []              #This solution works, but you can get the same number twice!

    # 6.times do
    #   @lotto_numbers << rand(1..60)
    # end

    # possible_numbers = (1..60).to_a
    # @lotto_numbers = []

    # 6.times do
    #   # @lotto_numbers << possible_numbers.sample   # Still wouldn't duplicate
    #   # @lotto_numbers << possible_numbers.shuffle.pop   # Still wouldn't duplicate
    #   # @lotto_numbers << possible_numbers.shuffle!.pop   # Finally duplicates!
    #   @lotto_numbers << possible_numbers.shuffle!.pop   # Finally duplicates!
    # end

    # Simplest (probably?) solution:
    possible_numbers = (1..60).to_a.shuffle
    @lotto_numbers = possible_numbers.pop(6)
    @formatted_numbers = @lotto_numbers.join(", ")

    render 'lotto_view.json.jbuilder'
  end
end

Notes on some of the methods used :
• The `to_a` method takes a range of numbers and turns it into an array.
• `.shuffle` randomizes an array. 
• `.pop(n)` returns the last `n` elements of an array. 
  • See `.push` for the opposite effect. 
• `join(separator=$,) → str` takes an array, and creates a string by converting each element of the array into a string, separated by a given separator. For example, `[1, 2, 3].join(", ")` yields `"1, 2, 3"`. 

```

In `fortune/app/views/api/my_examples/lotto_view.json.jbuilder`:

```
json.formatted_numbers = @formatted numbers
json.lotto_numbers @lotto_numbers
```

If you go to `localhost:3000/lotto_url`, you'll see the correct page.
