# W02D03 - More About Databases

## Database Types

* SQL are the most common database language. It's so common, that there's 2 main categories: (1) SQL databases, and (2) NoSQL databases. Think of it as a series of Excel spreadsheets with columns and rows.
  * In NoSQL databases, there's no standard format. Anything goes.
* How do you decide which database to use? Generally, reading or writing speed.
  * This decision will usually be made on the executive level.
  * More organization up front means slower write times, but fast read times because when you need to access the information you know exactly where it is. The inverse is also true.
    * Think: throwing anything you can grab in your closet v. carefully putting it in 

Postgres is a SQL database that looks like a spreadsheet (columns and rows).

## In-Class Example - Creating a Mini Capstone App

Note that I'm using my products, not the ones that Josh used in the example.

```bash
rails new mini_capstone
cd mini_capstone

git add --all
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Go to github.com, and create a repository named mini_capstone. Take the existing repository command-line commands from Github:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/markhilkert/mini_capstone.git
git push -u origin master

rails generate controller api/products
subl .
git add --all
git commit -m "created products controller"

rails generate model Product name:string price:integer image_url:string description:string
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
git add --all
git commit -m "created Product model"

rails console
```

You opened a rails console:

```ruby
product = Product.new(name: "cesium", price: 5, image_url: "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytxx95g-kiA/maxresdefault.jpg",description: "The most reactive, non-radioactive element")
product.save      # You should see text in color if it works
exit
```

Go to the `db/seeds.rb`. You can type rails console code in here, and it will automate what we've been previously typing into the console individually. You run it with a rake command `rake db:seed`. We're going to use it to add more products. 

In `db/seed.rb`:

```ruby
product = Product.new(name: "adamantium", price: 500, image_url: "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/xmenmovies/images/8/84/Adamantium-X2.png/revision/latest?cb=20140608100146",description: "Useful for applications where a lot of strength is needed")
product.save

product = Product.new(name: "dilithium", price: 100, image_url: "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/e/ef/Dilithium_crystal_graphic.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091220084650&path-prefix=en",description: "Do you need to go really fast??")
product.save

product = Product.new(name: "frinkonium", price: 1, image_url: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/71/Frink.png/160px-Frink.png",description: "Glayvin!")
product.save

product = Product.new(name: "U-238", price: 50, image_url: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Uranium03.jpg/1200px-Uranium03.jpg",description: "It's probably stable, don't worry too much.")
product.save

product = Product.new(name: "U-235", price: 75, image_url: "https://d2jmvrsizmvf4x.cloudfront.net/z6QOH7jMRYKfuR0nXRXn_image004.jpg",description: "Be careful with this one.")
product.save
```

Back to the Console. Note that you should **only** run this once. Every time you type `rake db:seed` it executes all of the code from that file, indescriminately. This is important when you are inputting large amounts of data, or if you're adding data to a large website. If we typed in in twice here, we'd have duplicate items in our database (each with a unique id).

```bash
rake db:seed 
rails console
```

In the rails console:

```ruby
Product.all   # To check that our data added properly
exit
```

Back to the terminal:

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "added product objects to db"
```

Open your 3 usual files:

In config/routes.rb

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    get "/first_product" => 'products#first_product'
    get "/all_products" => 'products#all_products'
  end
end
```

In `app/controllers/api/products_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class Api::ProductsController < ApplicationController

  def first_product
    @products = Product.first
    render 'first_product.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def all_products
    @products = Product.all
    render 'all_products.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

In `app/views/api/products/products.json.jbuilder`:

```
json.id @product.id
json.name @product.name
json.price @product.price
json.image_url @product.image_url
json.description @product.description
```

In `app/views/api/products/all_products.json.jbuilder`, we create an array of hashes in JSON:

```ruby
json.array! @products.each do |product|   # Create an array from the input from @products
  json.id product.id
  json.name product.name
  json.price product.price
  json.image_url product.image_url
  json.description product.description
end    
```

Note that the above is the synatx for creating an array & hashes 

In the terminal (must be in mini_console directory):

```bash
rails server
```



## In-Class Example #2 - Updating our Contacts App

```bash
cd contacts_app
subl .
```

If you go to `contacts_app/Gemfile` in your contacts, you can see all of the gem files that are necessary to run rails (?). We can also add gems. Note: do not put new gems in the groups at the bottom, because it gets messy. We're going to add the gem Faker (https://github.com/stympy/faker). Look for `Faker::Name`. We're going to use this and Faker::Internet (for e-mails), and Faker::PhoneNumber.

In `contacts_app/Gemfile`, add the following:

```ruby
gem "faker"
```

In the terminal:

```bash
bundle install
```

This downloads all the bundles listed in your gem file (specific to the directory that you are in). Since we just added `gem "faker"` to the Gemfile, we need to run this command to access it.


In `db/seeds.rb`:

```ruby
1001.times do 

  first_name = Faker::Name.first_name
  last_name = Faker::Name.last_name

  contact = Contact.new(
                        first_name: first_name,
                        last_name: last_name,
                        email: Faker::Internet.free_email("#{first_name}.#{last_name}"),
                        phone_number: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number
                        )
  contact.save
end

```

In the terminal:

```bash
rake db:seed
rails console
```
This runs our seed file. We just created 1001 new, random contacts.

In the rails console:

```
Contact.all
Contact.count
contacts.each { |contact| p contact }  # This line doesn't work. Why?
```


## Deeper into Ruby Conditionals

<< Insert handwritten notes >>

### Practice

"WAT" (truthy)
0 (truthy)
true (truthy)
nil (falsey)
false (falsey)

false (falsey)
0 (truthy)
true (truthy)
false (falsey)

false 
nil
true or [3,4]
!5


Instead of writing `if condition == false` write `if !condition`.
