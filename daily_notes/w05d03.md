# HTML oh no

```bash
mkdir html_exercises
touch html_example.html
```

In `html_example.html`

<!DOCTYPE html>           <!-- Communicates "this is an html document" -->
<html>                    <!-- Here's where it starts! -->

<head>                    <!-- Meta information goes here, e.g., keywords for search engines -->
</head>

<body>                    <!-- What you want to display in the browser window goes here. -->
</body> 

</html>

There's a

`html + tab` in sublime text, it'll give you the basic structure of an html document, seen here:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

`<div>` is the swiss army knife of html. If you don't know where something is going to go, put it in a div tab.

Following along with Josh: labeling is very important.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="main">
    <div>
      <div>
        HTML is helpful
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Content is Golden
      </div>
      <div>
        Only when well organized
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>


html is all about labeling. like so:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="main">
    <div class="section-1">
      <div class="heading-1">
        HTML is helpful
      </div><!-- end of .heading-1 -->
    </div><!-- end of .section-1 -->
    <div class="section-2">
      <div class="paragraph-1">
        Content is Golden
      </div><!-- end of .paragraph-1 -->
      <div class="paragraph-2">
        Only when well organized
      </div><!-- end of .paragraph-2 -->
    </div><!-- end of .section-2 -->
  </div><!--- end of .main -->
</body>
</html>

To make this more readable, there are pre-defined tags to accomplish what we're doing:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="main">
    <div class="section-1">
      <h1>
        HTML is helpful
      </h1>
    </div><!-- end of .section-1 -->
    <div class="section-2">
      <p>
        Content is Golden
      </p>
      <p>
        Only when well organized
      </p>
    </div><!-- end of .section-2 -->
  </div><!--- end of .main -->
</body>
</html>

## Another Example: Open the cookbook app

Right now, our show is compiling information down into json. But we want to send back html.

In the recipes controller:

```ruby
def show
  @recipe = Recipe.find(params[:id])
  render 'show.html'
end
```

In the recipes show:

```ruby

```

Create a file `show.html.erb` in the recipes view folder. erb stands for embedded ruby. We need to add something to our html to interact with dynamic variables.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1> Bonjour! </h1>
  <h1> Your recipe is: <%= @recipe.title %> </h1>
  <h1> The ingredients are: <%= @recipe.ingredients %> </h1>
  <h1> Prep time is: <%= @recipe.prep_time %> minutes. </h1>
</body>
</html>

You can use your model methods in the view, and it has access to all your instance variables defined in the controller. So we are able to access @recipes, and we can also use our friendly_prep_time variable defined in our method.

In .erb files, the skull tags <%= %>

Now we're going to create a rails client application that consumes the api (and json messages). We're going to skip the active record, which skips creating a database, models that talk to a database (no .find, .all, .where, etc.), and the active record. Since you're not creating a database, no need to rake db:create.

```bash
cd actualize
rails new cookbook_client --skip-active-record
cd cookbook_client
rails g controller client/recipes
```

We need to open up a second port because we're already running a host on port 3000. Just add one for every server from 3000. Try not to run 2 or 3 at once. If you go above 3010 you might mess up other things happening on your computer.

We're going to run the server in another window using a different theme. In the terminal window, Shell > open new window > Red sands (theme). Then put it side-by-side with your other server. Now you can keep track of both on the same screen. Hooray!

```bash
rails s -p 3001
```

In the client app, go to `routes.rb`

Note the `:client` instead of `:api`!

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :client do
    get '/recipes' => 'recipes#index'
  end
end
```

Below, the client app recipes controller. Normally here we would get the recipes using `@recipes = Recipe.all`. BUT we didn't create a database! So we can't use that command. We need to get the information from our api.

```ruby
class Client::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
    @recipes = response.parse
    render 'index.html.erb'
  end
end
```

Create a file in the view named `index.html.erb`. 

This one will show a jumble of recipe objects

```erb
<%= @recipes %>
```

If we try to look at the titles only by putting this (`<%= @recipes[0][:title] %>`) in the the file, it doesn't work because hashes are no longer stored as symbols. You need to reference the key as a string. JSON doesn't have anything that's equivalent to a symbol. To get the title, your .erb file will look like this:

```erb
<%= @recipes[1]["title"] %>
```

Now we're going to break up the file using each:

```erb
<%= @recipes.each do |recipe| %>
  <h2><%= recipe["title"] %> </h2>
  <h3><%= recipe["chef"] %> </h3>
  <h3><%= recipe["ingredients"] %> </h3>
  <h4><%= recipe["directions"] %> </h4>
  <br>
<%= end %>

```

NOTE! There are printing skull tags, and non-printing skull tags (<%= %> vs <% %>). Each loops return the object they were given, so here we use a non-printing skull tag because we don't care to see all the junk we put into the each loop.

### Now let's create our show action

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :client do
    get '/recipes' => 'recipes#index'
    get 'recipes/:id'=> 'recipes#show'
  end
end
```

Adding the show logic to our 

```ruby
class Client::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
    @recipes = response.parse
    render 'index.html.erb'
  end

  def show
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes/#{params[:id]}")
    # Params hash is a special hash, can call keys using either strings or symbols. Note that we're able to use interpolation because we're in a pure ruby file.
    @recipe = response.parse
    render 'show.html.erb'
  end
end
```

Now create a `show.html.erb`:

  <h1> <%= @recipe["title"] %> </h1>
  <h3> Chef: <%= @recipe["chef"] %> </h2>
  <h4> Prep Time: <%= @recipe["prep_time"] %> </h4>
  <h4> Ingredients: <%= @recipe["ingredients"] %> </h4>
  <h4> Recipe: <%= @recipe["directions"] %> </h4>

Now we're going to do a bit more formatting, and use an each loop to display ingredients more professionally.

  <h1> <%= @recipe["title"] %> </h1>
  <h3> Chef: <%= @recipe["chef"] %> </h2>
  <h4> Prep Time: <%= @recipe["friendly_prep_time"] %> </h4>
  <h4> Ingredients: </h4>
    <% @recipe["formatted"]["ingredients"].each do |ingredient| %>
      <ul>
        <li> <% ingredient %> </li>
      </ul>
    <% end %>
  <h4> Recipe: <%= @recipe["formatted"]["directions"] %> </h4>
