# Ruby Basics

* Ruby is a dynamic, higher order, object oriented programming language. Ruby is written with the coder in mind. 
* Ruby is a general language (contrast: R, for statistics)
* Javascript is the only programming language that can run on a browser.
* At its core, programming is all about automating repeatable tasks.

## How to Practice P.I.E. (Plan Implement Evaluate)

### Plan 
* Think about the real-world implications, e.g.,
  * What's your desired result?
  * What do you have? (tools? data?)
  * It can be helpful to think of something physical
* Do Research
  * Search online using keywords
    * ruby-doc.org is your best friend (contains all defined ruby methods, no bullshit)
    * Google, but 
    	* 	keep it to the method syntax 
    	*  don't be overly verbose
    	*  Put the most important words first.
    * StackOverflow = BAD! Avoid. You don't want others solutions, you want the building blocks that will help you solve your problems. You'll also run into plagarism.

### Evaluate
* Is this the best solution? 
* Was there a better way to get the answer? (this will make you more effecitve in the future)
* Before moving on, do I need to change anything?
* Refactor (i.e., clean up the code)

## Pseudocode
* Break big steps into small chunks & write it out in easy-to-read language.
