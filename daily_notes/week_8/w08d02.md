# A break from Vue. Let's do some Javascript.

We want to attach javascript to this html page, `alexander.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p>Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

To do this, we're going to use the [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp). When you're talking about the DOM, you're talking about accessing html elements. We'll start by adding script tags:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 onclick="doSomething()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p>Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log("You clicked me!!!")
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

When you navigate to the page in your browser, and click on Alexander Hamilton, the console logs `You Clicked me!!!`.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 onmouseover="doSomething()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p>Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    alert("Wait! Before you leave, try some of our deals!!!!")
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Now, since the `<h1>` tags go across the entire top of the page, whenever you try and exit the page by navigating to another one or x'ing it out, you cross over the h1 tag and the alert pops up.

Here's a [list](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp) of the all the possible events that you can have.

### In Class Exercise: DOM Events

#### 1. Modify the code such that the message prints to the console on double click instead of on mouse down.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 ondblclick="doSomething()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p>Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log("You double clicked me! How dastardly!")
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. Modify the code such that a different message prints to the console when you click on the p tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p ondblclick="doSomething()">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log("You double clicked me! How dastardly!")
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Josh demo: He added another function, instead of changing it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 ondblclick="doSomething()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p ondblclick="doSomethingElse()">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log("You double clicked me! How dastardly!")
  }

  function doSomethingElse() {
    console.log("Don't touch my <p> tag")
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

#### 3. Modify the code such that a message prints to the console whenever the mouse moves over the h1 tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 onmouseover="doSomething()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p>Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log("I've been moused over. How embarrassing.")
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Josh Demo: Use `onmousemove`, it executes every time the mouse moves a pixel. This is a hint for the bonus.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 onmousemove="doSomething()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p ondblclick="doSomethingElse()">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log("You double clicked me! How dastardly!")
  }

  function doSomethingElse() {
    console.log("Don't touch my <p> tag")
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

#### Bonus 1: Print the x and y coordinates of the mouse to the console whenever the mouse is moving over the h1 tag.

Some useful info from [w3 Mouse Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_mouseevent.asp):

Property | Event
--------- | --------
clientX  | Returns the horizontal coordinate of the mouse pointer, relative to the current window, when the mouse event was triggered
clientY | Returns the vertical coordinate of the mouse pointer, relative to the current window, when the mouse event was triggered

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 onmousemove="showCoords(event)">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p ondblclick="doSomethingElse()">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function showCoords(event) {
    var x = event.clientX;
    var y = event.clientY;
    console.log('X: ' + x + ' Y: ' + y)
  }

  function doSomethingElse() {
    console.log("Don't touch my <p> tag")
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Bonus 2: Find a way to make the x and y coordinates show up on the web page itself!

We'll use a span tag to target a specific element. We'll use a tool in Javascript called query selector, which allows us to target a specific html element to manipulate it with Javascript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 onmousemove="showCoords(event)">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p ondblclick="doSomethingElse()">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

  <p> The x coordinate is: <span class="x-coordinate">unknown...</span></p>
  <p> The x coordinate is: <span class="y-coordinate">unknown...</span></p>

<script>
  function showCoords(event) {
    var x = event.clientX;
    var y = event.clientY;

    var xTag = document.querySelector('.x-coordinate')
    var yTag = document.querySelector('.y-coordinate')

    xTag.innerText = x;
    yTag.innerText = y;
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

xTag allows us to target the entire html element. If we printed it, we would print `<span class="x-coordinate">unknown...</span></p>`. If we just want to target the inner text (`unknown...`), we would use `xTag.innerText`. You can also use `.innerText` to set the the inner text of your html element. And that's how we solved this.

### More In-class DOM manipulation

Now we're going to write a function that hides the paragraph when you click on the heading. We're going to use `classList`, which returns the class names of an element.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 onclick="hideParagrpah()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function hideParagraph() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    console.log(pTag.classList)
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Now our class list is "bacon" and "eggs". The console log looks like this:

```
 ["bacon", "eggs", value: "bacon eggs"]
```

Now we're going to add a class called hidden, which we defined in css to not display, which we will add to the class when we click it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .hidden {
      display: none;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1 onclick="hideParagraph()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function hideParagraph() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    pTag.classList.add('hidden');
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Now let's make it so we can toggle the hidden value.

Using a method called `contains(class)`, which returns a boolean value if a class exists on an element.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .hidden {
      display: none;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1 onclick="hideParagraph()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function hideParagraph() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    if (pTag.classList.contains('hidden')) {
      pTag.classList.remove('hidden');
    } else {
    pTag.classList.add('hidden');
    }
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Now the fast version, using `toggle`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .hidden {
      display: none;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1 onclick="hideParagraph()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function hideParagraph() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');

    pTag.toggle('hidden');
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```


Now let's take a look at `style`, which returns all the style for an element (returns a giant hash of css pairs):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .hidden {
      display: none;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1 onclick="hideParagraph()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function hideParagraph() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    console.log(pTag.style);
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Now let's manipulate the style

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .hidden {
      display: none;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1 onclick="hideParagraph()">Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

<script>
  function hideParagraph() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    pTag.style["color"] = 'red';
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This changes the paragraph color to red. We could also have changed it using `pTag.style.color = 'red';`. 

### In class exercises:

#### 1. Add a button to your page such that when you click the button, the header text turns red.

Note that I did this using a class, but I could also have chosen to just modify that element. I'll try that in the next part of this exercise.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .red {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

  <button onclick="toggleHeadersRed()"> Toggle Red Headers </button>

<script>
  function toggleHeadersRed() {
    var hTag = document.querySelector('h1');
    hTag.classList.toggle('red');
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. Change the code such that clicking on the button changes the left padding of the header to 100 pixels.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

  <button onclick="toggleHeaderPosition()"> Shift Header </button>

<script>
  function toggleHeaderPosition() {
    var hTag = document.querySelector('h1');
    if (hTag.style["padding-left"] === '50px') {
      hTag.style["padding-left"] = '0px';  
    } else {
      hTag.style["padding-left"] = '50px';  
    }
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This wasn't the best way to do this, because I couldn't use toggle. So it would've been better to use classes, rather than in-line styling.

Note that if you wanted to use dot syntax, you couldn't use `.padding-left`, because it thinks you want to subtract left from padding. Instead, you would need to use loweCamelCase. That is, `.paddingLeft`.

Josh solved it this way:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .padded {
      padding-left: 100px;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

  <button onclick="toggleHeadersRed()"> Shift Headers </button>

<script>
  function toggleHeadersRed() {
    var hTag = document.querySelector('h1');
    hTag.classList.toggle('padded');
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```


#### Bonus: Change the code such that clicking on the button changes the header text to a random color (this requires some googling...).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .padded {
      padding-left: 100px;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

  <button onclick="makeRed()"> Make it Red </button>
  <button onclick="padTheLeft()"> Move it Over </button>
  <button onclick="toggleHeadersRed()"> Shift Headers </button>
  <button onclick="randomColor()"> Random Background Color </button>

<script>
  function toggleHeadersRed() {
    var hTag = document.querySelector('h1');
    hTag.classList.toggle('padded');
  }

  function makeRed() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    pTag.classList.add('red');
  }

  function randomColor() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    var greenValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
    var redValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
    var blueValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
    pTag.style.color = 'rbv(' + redValue + ',' + greenValue + ',' + blueValue + ')';
  }

</script>

</body>
</html>
```

^^^ Doesn't work, go back to the video (eventually) and fix this.

Let's clean this up a bit

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .padded {
      padding-left: 100px;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

  <button onclick="makeRed()"> Make it Red </button>
  <button onclick="padTheLeft()"> Move it Over </button>
  <button onclick="toggleHeadersRed()"> Shift Headers </button>
  <button onclick="randomColor()"> Random Background Color </button>

<script>
  function toggleHeadersRed() {
    var hTag = document.querySelector('h1');
    hTag.classList.toggle('padded');
  }

  function makeRed() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    pTag.classList.add('red');
  }

  function randomColor() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    var colorList = ['green', 'red', 'blue', 'white', 'purple', 'yellow'];
    var pickedColor = colorList(Math.floor(Math.random * colorList.length));
    pTag.style.color = pickedColor
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Now let's do it using hexidecimal:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .padded {
      padding-left: 100px;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Alexander Hamilton</h1>
  <p class="bacon eggs">Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper.</p>

  <button onclick="makeRed()"> Make it Red </button>
  <button onclick="padTheLeft()"> Move it Over </button>
  <button onclick="toggleHeadersRed()"> Shift Headers </button>
  <button onclick="randomColor()"> Random Background Color </button>

<script>
  function toggleHeadersRed() {
    var hTag = document.querySelector('h1');
    hTag.classList.toggle('padded');
  }

  function makeRed() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    pTag.classList.add('red');
  }

  function randomColor() {
    var pTag = document.querySelector('p');
    var characters = ['0123456789ABCDEF']
    var color = '#';
    for(var i = 0; i < 6; i++ 1) {
      color += characters[Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length)];
    }
    pTag.style.color = color;
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Now we're going to ignore what we've done entirely from here on out. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .padded {
      padding-left: 100px;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <p onclick="changePagraph(this)"> First p tag</p>
  <p onclick="changePagraph(this)"> Second p tag</p>
  <p onclick="changePagraph(this)"> Third p tag</p>
  <p onclick="changePagraph(this)"> Fourth p tag</p>

<script>
  function changeParagraph(pTag) {
    pTag.classList.add('red');
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This allows you to select individual p tags. Otherwise, `querySelector` will always select the first p tag.

If we want to select everything, rather than just the first instance, we use `querySelectorAll`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>

  <style>
    .padded {
      padding-left: 100px;
    }
    .blue {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <p onclick="changeParagraph(this)"> First p tag</p>
  <p onclick="changeParagraph(this)"> Second p tag</p>
  <p onclick="changeParagraph(this)"> Third p tag</p>
  <p onclick="changeParagraph(this)"> Fourth p tag</p>

  <button onclick="styleAllParagraphs()"> Style Them All</button>

<script>
  function changeParagraph(pTag) {
    pTag.classList.toggle('red');
  }

  function styleAllParagraphs() {
    var pTags = document.querySelectorAll('p');
    pTags.forEach( function(pTag) {
      pTag.classList.toggle('blue')
    });
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Note that this button only adds the blue class, and it does not take the red class off. So which color wins? Whichever color is on the bottom (right now, blue). So if we want the red that we've clicked to win out, we just need to move red below the blue in the style tags. The last one wins, or the more specific one wins. So we could have also said red applies to paragraphs, and since it's more specific it would win out.


### In-class exercise:

#### 1. Clicking on a todo repeatedly should toggle between complete and incomplete, where a completed task has strikethrough text. (hint: make a CSS class called .complete - you’ll need to Google the CSS that makes strikethrough text.)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>To Do list</title>

  <style>
    .complete {
      text-decoration: line-through;
    }
  </style>

</head>

<body>
  <h2>To-do List:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Pay bills</p> </li>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Wash car</p> </li>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Get laundry</p> </li>
  </ol>

<script>
  function toggleComplete(task) {
    task.classList.toggle('complete');
  }
</script>
  
</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. Add a button “Hide completed tasks” which will hide all tasks that have been marked complete. (hint: make a CSS class called .hidden)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>To Do list</title>

  <style>
    .complete {
      text-decoration: line-through;
    }

    .hidden {
      display: none;
    }
  </style>

</head>

<body>
  <h2>To-do List:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Pay bills</p> </li>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Wash car</p> </li>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Get laundry</p> </li>
  </ol>

  <button onclick="hideCompletedTasks()">Hide Completed Tasks</button>

<script>
  function toggleComplete(task) {
    task.classList.toggle('complete');
  }

  function hideCompletedTasks() {
    var completedTasks = document.querySelectorAll('.complete');
    completedTasks.forEach( function(completedTask) {
      completedTask.classList.add('hidden');
    });
  }
</script>
  
</body>
</html>

```


#### 3. Add a button “Show all tasks” which will unhide any hidden tasks to see the complete list.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>To Do list</title>

  <style>
    .complete {
      text-decoration: line-through;
    }

    .hidden {
      display: none;
    }
  </style>

</head>

<body>
  <h2>To-do List:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Pay bills</p> </li>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Wash car</p> </li>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Get laundry</p> </li>
  </ol>

  <button onclick="hideCompletedTasks()">Hide Completed Tasks</button>
  <button onclick="showAllTasks()"></button>

<script>
  function toggleComplete(task) {
    task.classList.toggle('complete');
  }

  function hideCompletedTasks() {
    var completedTasks = document.querySelectorAll('.complete');
    completedTasks.forEach( function(completedTask) {
      completedTask.classList.add('hidden');
    });
  }

  function showAllTasks() {
    var hiddenTasks = document.querySelectorAll('.hidden');
    hiddenTasks.forEach( function(hiddenTask) {
      hiddenTask.classList.remove('hidden');
    });
  }
</script>
  
</body>
</html>
```

#### Bonus: Add a new tag that displays a count of how many complete tasks there are in the list. It should automatically update each time tasks are marked as complete.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>To Do list</title>

  <style>
    .complete {
      text-decoration: line-through;
    }

    .hidden {
      display: none;
    }
  </style>

</head>

<body>
  <h2>To-do List:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Pay bills</p> </li>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Wash car</p> </li>
    <li> <p onclick="toggleComplete(this)">Get laundry</p> </li>
  </ol>

  <button onclick="hideCompletedTasks()">Hide Completed Tasks</button>
  <button onclick="showAllTasks()"> Show Completed Tasks </button>

  <h4> Number of Items Completed: <span id="num-complete"> 0 </span></h4>

<script>
  function toggleComplete(task) {
    task.classList.toggle('complete');

    var completedTasks = document.querySelectorAll('.complete');
    var numCompleteTag = document.querySelector('#num-complete');
    numCompleteTag.innerText = completedTasks.length
  }

  function hideCompletedTasks() {
    var completedTasks = document.querySelectorAll('.complete');
    completedTasks.forEach( function(completedTask) {
      completedTask.classList.add('hidden');
    });
  }

  function showAllTasks() {
    var hiddenTasks = document.querySelectorAll('.hidden');
    hiddenTasks.forEach( function(hiddenTask) {
      hiddenTask.classList.remove('hidden');
    });
  }
</script>
  
</body>
</html>
```

#### Double bonus: Add more features to make your todo app similar to this example app (don’t worry about making it look pretty): http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/
