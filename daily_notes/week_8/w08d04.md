# Mini-Lessons: File Uploads, Themes

## Creating a new app that you can upload picture to

If you're doing this in production, you'll need to attach photo to an AWS (Amazon Web Services) bucket. There are lot of tutorials online for how to do this.

```bash
rails new profile_image_example
cd profile_image_example
rails g model Profile name 
rails g controller api/profiles
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
subl .
```

Note that we didn't attach an image to the Profile model yet. That's going to come later.

In `routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    get "/profiles" => "profiles#index"
    post '/profiles' => 'profiles#create'
  end
end

```

In `application_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
end
```


In `profiles_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class Api::ProfilesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @profiles = Profile.all
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def create
    Profile.create(
                  name: params[:name]
                  )

    @profiles = Profile.all
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

end

```

Don't use `create!` in a controller action. It blows up when it fails. You don't want your live website to blow up when the create action fails. `create!` is useful in a `seeds.rb` file because it blows up, but that's not always what you want.

In `index.json.jbuilder`:

```json
json.array! @profiles.each do |profile|
  json.id profile.id
  json.name profile.name
end
```

Head on over to the cors.rb and uncomment 

## Creating a Vue app to go with our backend

```bash
vue create profile_example_vue_app
cd profile_example_vue_app
npm install axios --save
subl .
```

In `Home.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <div class="home">

    <div>
      <input v-model="newName">
      <button v-on:click="createProfile()"> Go</button>
    </div>

    <div v-for="profile in profiles">
      <h2> {{profile.name}} </h2>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<style>
</style>

<script>
var axios = require('axios');

export default {
  data: function() {
    return {
      profiles: [],
      newName: ""
    };
  },
  created: function() {
    axios.get("/api/profiles")
      .then(response => {
        this.profiles = response.data
      });
  },
  methods: {
    createProfile: function() {
      var params = {
                    name: this.newName
                    };
      axios.post("/api/profiles", params)
        .then( response => {
          this.profiles = response.data;
          this.newName = "";
        });
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

In `main.js`:

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import router from './router';
import axios from "axios";

axios.defaults.baseURL = 
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "http://localhost:3000" : "/";

Vue.config.productionTip = false

new Vue({
  router,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

```
```

## Installing Active Storage in our Backend

In `profile_image_example`:

```bash
rails active_storage:install
rake db:migrate
```

In `profile.rb`:

```ruby
class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :image
end
```

In `profiles_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class Api::ProfilesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @profiles = Profile.all
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def create
    Profile.create(
                  name: params[:name],
                  image: params[:image]
                  )

    @profiles = Profile.all
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

end

```

In `index.json.jbuilder`:

```json
json.array! @profiles.each do |profile|
  json.id profile.id
  json.name profile.name
  json.image_url rails_blog_url(profile.image) if profile.image.attachment
end
```

Restart your backend server, and then head back to the Vue application.

Hashes aren't sufficient to hold a binary file, so we have to use a different type of container called form data. It's basically the same thing (we're still building a hash in params), 

In `Home.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <div class="home">

    <form v-on:submit.prevent="submit()">
      <div>
        <input v-model="newName">
      </div>
      <div>
        Image: <input type="file" v-on:change="setFile($event)" ref="fileInput">
      </div>
      <input type="submit" value="Go">Choose file</input>
    </form>

    <div v-for="profile in profiles">
      <h2> {{ profile.name }} </h2>
      <img :src="profile.image_url" alt="profile.name">
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<style>
</style>

<script>
var axios = require('axios');

export default {
  data: function() {
    return {
      profiles: [],
      newName: "",
      newImage: ""
    };
  },
  created: function() {
    axios.get("/api/profiles")
      .then(response => {
        this.profiles = response.data
      });
  },
  methods: {
    submit: function() {
      var params = new FormData();
      params.append("name", this.newName);     // to add to FormData, you append. The arguments are key/value
      params.append("image", this.newImage);

      axios.post("/api/profiles", params)
        .then( response => {
          this.profiles = response.data;
          this.newName = "";
          this.$refs.fileInput.value = "";    // blanks out the image after it's successfully submitted
        });
    },
    setFile: function(event) {
      if (event.target.files.length > 0) {
        this.newImage = event.target.files[0]
      }
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

There's also a cheat sheet for this, which has most of this in a format you can copy and paste from.

## Themes - How to Easily Style your Applications

Other people have built these on top of Bootstrap so it actually looks like a full fledged production application. They've thought through the design, so you don't have to worry about "2 pixels to the left; 2 pixels to the right" stuff. 

It's important to remember that this just makes it look pretty; it doesn't fix a back-end sloppiness. This is something that can help you impress people that don't understand all the hard work you've done on the back end.

When purchasing themes for your capstone, get approval before first to make sure you don't waste your money on a theme you can't use. 

A couple useful sites to check out are [Wrap Bootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/themes?branch=4.x) and [bestofThemes](https://www.bestofthemes.com/?q=&hPP=10&idx=themes_production&p=0&dFR%5Btheme_library%5D%5B0%5D=Bootstrap&fR%5Bplatforms%5D%5B0%5D=HTML%20Template&nR%5Bparent%5D%5B%3C%3D%5D%5B0%5D=0&is_v=1)

**Make sure to get Bootstrap 4 themes** because bootstrap 3 is significantly different and will not be compatible with Bootstrap 4 conventions. These themes are for html, css, and javascript only. Avoid any that say "Admin" because their graph logic will be so complex you'll spend a week untangling it, instead of building your own graphs in a day.

After you bought it...

Go to vue app `index.html`, rename it `old_index.html` in case you need it. 

Paste any files that you need into the public folder. All relative links should load correctly. 

## Netlify: Make Your Code Public

Note: we will have a cheatsheet for this also.

```bash
cd cookbook_vue_app
touch cookbook_vue_app/public/_redirects
```

In `_redirects`:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "added netlify settings"
git push origin master
```
