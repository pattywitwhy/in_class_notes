## Review of the Insomnia Sign-in Process

### Authorization/Authentication on the Back-end

First, let's make a new user using Insomnia. Use `POST` for a create action, sent to `localhost:3000/api/users/`. Send in 

key | value
---- | -----
`name` | Beverly Crusher
`email` | bev@gmail.com
 `password` | password
 `password_confirmation` | password

Then, to create a new session send in `email` and `password` to `localhost:3000/api/sessions/`. When the session is created, we get a jwt token back. The jwt token is a long string of characters. We need to take that jwt token and put it in the header of insomnia for future requests to be authorized. 

key | value
---- | -----
`Authorization` | `Bearer ` + jwt token you just received

## In-class exercise: Add login/logout to your Cookbook App

Josh sent us a very detailed cheatsheet about this.

Then, paste in the code from Josh's demo for adding authentication to the Nav bar in Bootstrap.

To tell if you're logged in, inspect the page, then look at `Application` > `local storage` > the url you would like to see if you're logged into. There should be a key/value pair with `jwt`/your long jwt token. 


### In-class exercise

If it says you have the Ruby version

1. Change the ruby version to `ruby '2.5.3'`
2. Delete `Gemfile.lock`
3. Delete `.ruby-version`
