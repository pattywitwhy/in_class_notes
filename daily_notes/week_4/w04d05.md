# Another day, where I'm behind

### Something Something Mini Capstone

In `seeds.rb`:

```ruby
Category.create(name: 'Deals')
Category.create(name: 'Non-radioactive')
Category.create(name: 'Radioactive')
Category.create(name: 'Rare')
Category.create(name: 'Magical')
Category.create(name: 'Expensive')
```

Then run your seed file:

```bash
rake db:seed
rails c
```

Now let's look at the categories we created

```ruby
Category.all                # Shows you all the categories, kinda hard to read
Category.pluck(:id, :name)  # This shows us more nicely formatted categories
```

Back to db > `seeds.rb`:

```ruby
# When you look at the category ids that you plucked, write down their category ids so you can associate them with your products.

ProductCategory.create(product_id: 1, category_id: 1)  # Numbers are made up, you should actually look at these.

# Write out a lot of these, every product should have at least one category, and to demonstrate the many-to-many relationship, at least one product needs to belong to multiple categories.
```

Back to the rails console:

```ruby
product = Product.find(5)
product.categories          # This return an array of the categories product 5 belongs to.

category = category.find(3) 
category.products           # Returns an array of all the products that belong to category 3.
```

Josh put this in his `category.rb` model, we didn't need to follow along:

```ruby
product_categories.map { |product_category| product_category.product }
```

We're going to add the ability to sort by category now. In `product_controller.rb`:

```ruby
def index 
  #stuff
  # @products = Product.all

  # category_name = params[:category]
  # if categorty_name
  #   # The long way:
  #   products = Product.all
  #   @products = []
  #   prodcuts.each do |product|
  #     category_names = product.categories.map { |category| category.name}
  #     if category_names.include?(category_name) == category_name
  #       @products << product
  #     end
  #   end
  # end
    
    # # Another long (but a little better) way
  # category_name = params[:category]
  # if categorty_name
    # @products = Product.all
    # category_names = product.categories.map { |category| category.name}
    # @product.select { |product| category_names.include?(category_name) == category_name }
  # end

    # Here's the real way to do it
    @products = Product.all

    category_name = params[:category]
    if categorty_name
      category = Category.find_by(name: category_name)
      @products = category.products
    end

  #more stuff
```

## Example: add groups to contacts (many-to-many relationship that reuqires a join table)

```bash
rails g model Group name
rails g model ContactGroup group_id:integer contact_id:integer

# After checking the migration files
rake db:migrate
```

In `contact.rb` class, add the following:

```ruby
has_many :contact_groups
has_many :groups, through: :contact_groups   # Must actually be in this order, because Ruby is top-down.
```

In `contact_group.rb` class, add the following:

```ruby
belongs_to :contact
belongs_to :group
```

In `group.rb`, add the following:

```ruby
has_many :contact_groups
has_many :contacts, through: :contact_groups
```

Now, let's connect contacts to groups using some magic that Josh will show us. Open up the rails console, we're going to poke around a bit.

```ruby
Contact.all         # Gives us all the contacts
Group.count         # Tells us how many groups we have
Group.pluck(:id)    # Gives us a list of all the group ids available now
                    # Useful b/c it gives us only the active groups, so if you've deleted a group you won't use 
                    # that number.
group_ids = _       # Assigns the last thing executed (Group.pluck(:id)) to group_ids
# ContactGroup.destroy_all    # Don't run this, it deletes all of your groups. You can do this later if you want to
                              # assign groups Josh's way instead of the (inferior) way I did it.

```

The main code to assign groups will go in the seeds file:

```ruby
contacts = Contact.all
group_ids = Group.pluck(:id)


  contacts.each do |contact|
    # ContactGroup.create(contact_id: contact.id, group_id: group_ids.sample ) # Only gives us 1 group per person
    selected_group_ids = group_ids.sample(rand(2..4))  # randomly selects 2, 3, or 4 groups to assign to a person.
    
    selected_group_ids.each do |variable|
      ContactGroup.create( contact_id: contact.id, group_id: group_id )
    end
  end
  
  
end
```

Back in the console

```ruby
group = Group.first         # Gives us the first group
group.contacts.count        # Tells us how many contacts are in that group

```

Creating a controller for groups

```bash
rails g controller api/groups
```

Create `_group.json.jbuilder` in the groups views, and add:

```ruby
json.id group.id
json.name group.name
```

Add to `_contact.json.jbuilder` in the views:

```ruby
json.groups do
  json.array! contact.groups, partial: 'api/groups/group', as: :group
end
```

Then you can go check it out on your localhost.


```ruby

```

```bash

```
