** How to delete an app **

If you want to delete an app, you should drop the database first. To do so, `rake db:drop` will drop the database. Do NOT do this for apps that you plan to use again, and you'll likely make a ton of extra work for yourself re-doing all your work instead of making a few minor modifications. If you need to delete the app, after you've deleted the database then rm -rf your app folder.

### Data Types

* **String:** Limited to 255 characters (depending on DBMS)
  * Use for short text fields (names, emails, etc)
* **Text:** Unlimited length (depending on DBMS)
  * Use for comments, blog posts, etc. General rule of thumb: if it's captured via textarea, use Text. For input using textfields, use string.
*  **Integer:** Whole numbers
* **Float:** Decimal numbers stored with floating point precision
  * Precision is fixed, which can be problematic for some calculations; generally no good for math operations due to inaccurate rounding.
* **Decimal:** Decimal numbers stored with precision that varies according to what is needed by your calculations; use these for math that needs to be accurate
  * See this post for examples and an in-depth explanation on the differences between floats and decimals.
* **Boolean:**
  * Use to store true/false attributes (i.e. things that only have two states, like on/off)
* **Binary:**
  * Use to store images, movies, and other files in their original, raw format in chunks of data called blobs
* **:primary_key**
  * Helpful if need to read something really quickly. 
  * This datatype is a placeholder that Rails translates into whatever primary key datatype your database of choice requires (i.e. serial primary key in postgreSQL). Its use is somewhat complicated and not recommended.
  * Use model and migration constraints (like validates_uniqueness_of and add_index with the :unique => true option) instead to simulate primary key functionality on one of your own fields.
* **Date:**
  * Stores only a date (year, month, day)
* **Time:**
  * Stores only a time (hours, minutes, seconds)
* **DateTime:**
  * Stores both date and time
* **Timestamp**
  * Stores both date and time
  * Note: For the purposes of Rails, both Timestamp and DateTime mean the same thing (use either type to store both date and time). For the TL;DR description of why both exist, read the bottom paragraph.


### Rails Guides

Rails guides is to rails, what ruby-docs.org is to ruby. https://guides.rubyonrails.org.

## Example: Migration App

```bash
rails new migration_app
cd migration_app
rails g model Product title description isbn  # Generates the attribution as strings, the default
# Navigate to db > migrate > ####_create products
# Check that this works before migrating, so you don't mess up the model. You can't change this later. 
rake db:migrate
```

Let's say we want to change our model later. We want to add price, but we already migrated. You **cannot** just change the \_create\_products file, because you already migrated. So no

```bash
rails g migration AddPriceToProducts    # Make sure this is plural
# >> db/migrate/20190122151701_add_price_to_products.rb
# 
```

```ruby
class AddPriceToProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    add_column :products, :price, :integer      # Adds a column to products, named price, that's an integer
  end
end
```

Now we need to migrate it

```bash
rake db:migrate
```


**What we did:** Fill this in later, josh went through a visual example of a database. Basically, rake db:create creates the file cabinet, migration creates the folders and structure, and db:seed fills the structure with actual data.

Next, we'll make a few changes to our model. Go to db > migrate > your new file. 

We're going to (1) change the produ

```bash
rails g migration MakeChangesToProducts
```

In `20190122154459_make_changes_to_products.rb`:

```ruby
class MakeChangesToProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    rename_column :products, :title, :name            # Changes the title category to name
    change_column :products, :description, :text      # Changes description from string type to text.
    change_column :products, :price, "numeric USING CAST(price AS numeric)" # Use this even if price is an integer, if you're changing to a decimal. See cheat sheet for more info.
    change_column :products, :price, :decimal, precision: 9, scale: 2  # Scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal (here: 2), and precision is the total number of digits allowed. Always define both precision and scale, or you will run into problems later. 
    remove_column :products, :isbn, :string     # Yes, you actually have to tell it the type of data you're removing. That's because there is a way to undo your undo, and if you do decide to roll back then roll forward it needs to know what type of data to create again.
  end
end
```

Note that you should avoid db rollback if at all possible. You can roll back your entire database on accident. Sometimes in production, you will actually have to do this. But in our class, we won't. It's kind of like git. Josh "Do not do this lightly. It usually errs out on you." 

Now, let's actually migrate it.


```bash
rake db:migrate
```

If your migration breaks, none of the changes are applied. You can go back to the migration file and correct your error, then migrate again. It's good practice to have changes all in individual migration files, with descriptive names. For examples if, AllMyChanges doesn't run, you have no idea where the error was. But if ChangePriceToDecimal fails, you know exactly what happened.

Once you're done, you can check to make sure your changes went through in the schema file. Just never change anything in the schema file

#### Shortcut to change/remove columns

Note: this is why naming conventions are important. Rails understands `Add<blank>To<blank>` structure, and `Remove<blank>From<blank>`. 

```bash
rails g migration AddStockToProducts stock:integer 
```

This pre-generates the add column line. Without making any changes, in `20190122161752_add_stock_to_products` it looks like this:

```ruby
class AddStockToProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    add_column :products, :stock, :integer
  end
end
```

Similarly:


```bash
rails g migration RemoveStockFromProducts stock:integer
```

In `20190122161903_remove_stock_from_products` it looks like this:


```ruby
class RemoveStockFromProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    remove_column :products, :stock, :integer
  end
end
```

Hooray! Always check that it autogenerated correctly, sometimes it doesn't.

## Example

Josh going through the in class example

```bash
rails g migration AddMiddleNameToContacts middle_name    #defaults to string
```

Go to the lastest migration file, and you'll find that it's already populated for you with:

```ruby
class AddMiddleNameToContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    add_column :contacts, :middle_name, :string
  end
end
```

```bash
rake db:migrate 
rails s
```

Check your schema, and make sure that the middle_name string was added. Next we'll want to add this to our view, so go to your partial `_contact`. Place it right between first_name and last name (preference).

```
  json.id contact.id
  
  json.first_name contact.first_name
  json.last_name contact.last_name
  json.email contact.email
  json.phone_number contact.phone_number
  json.bio contact.bio

  json.formatted do
    json.created_at contact.created_at
    json.updated_at contact.friendly_updated_at
    json.full_name contact.full_name
    json.japanese_phone_number contact.turning_japanese
  end
```

Then, don't forget to update git and sync w/ github.

Navigate to your controller file, edit it so it looks like this:

```ruby
  def create
    @contact = Contact.new(
                            first_name: params[:first_name],
                            middle_name: params[:middle_name],
                            last_name: params[:last_name],
                            email: params[:email],
                            phone_number: params[:phone_number]
                          )
    @contact.save
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end
```

In Insomnia, use the `POST` verb with the url `http://localhost:3000/api/contacts`, then fill in first_name, middle_name, last_name, email, phone_number.

Back in your controller files, edit the update part:

```ruby
  def update
    @contact = Contact.find(params[:id])

    @contact.first_name = params[:first_name] || @contact.first_name
    @contact.middle_name = params[:middle_name] || @contact.middle_name
    @contact.last_name = params[:last_name] || @contact.last_name
    @contact.email = params[:email] || @contact.email
    @contact.phone_number = params[:phone_number] || @contact.phone_number

    @contact.save
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'    
  end
```

```bash
rails generate migration AddBioToContacts bio:text
```

Go to the newest migration file and it should look like 

```ruby
class AddBioToContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    add_column :contacts, :bio, :text
  end
end

```

Apply it:

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

Look at your schema to make sure that bio is there. Then update git so your changes are saved, upload to github.

Back to the controller:

```ruby
  def create
    @contact = Contact.new(
                            first_name: params[:first_name],
                            middle_name: params[:middle_name],
                            last_name: params[:last_name],
                            email: params[:email],
                            phone_number: params[:phone_number],
                            bio: params[:bio]
                          )
    @contact.save
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end
```

```ruby
  def update
    @contact = Contact.find(params[:id])

    @contact.first_name = params[:first_name] || @contact.first_name
    @contact.middle_name = params[:middle_name] || @contact.middle_name
    @contact.last_name = params[:last_name] || @contact.last_name
    @contact.email = params[:email] || @contact.email
    @contact.phone_number = params[:phone_number] || @contact.phone_number

    @contact.save
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'    
  end
```


## Josh Demos Updates to the Mini Capstone

```bash
rails g migration MakeChangesOnProducts

```

In the new migration file, change it to the following:

```ruby
class AddBioToContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    change_column :products, :description, :text
    change_column :products, :price, "numeric USING CAST(price AS numeric)"
    change_column :products, :price, :decimal, precision: 10, scale: 2
    change_column :products, :in_stock, :boolean, default: true
  end
end
```

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

# Go back here after looking at the class video and update. Missed a bunch of stuff.

If we 

In the views file, add the following:

```json
json.in_stock product.in_stock?
```

Then ad the following to your gemfile: `gem 'seed_dump'`:

```bash
```

In `filename.rb`

```ruby
