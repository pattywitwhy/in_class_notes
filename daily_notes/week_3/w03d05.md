# Day 5

## In classe example

Changing index act



### Change the index action to return products sorted by id by default.

In the controller file, add this:

```ruby
@products = Product.all.order(:id)
```




### Change the index action to allow for searching by name (using params “search”).

In the controller file, add this:

```ruby

#redefine products so they aren't ordered before we sort
@products = Product.all

search_keyword = params[:search]
if search_keyword
  @products = @products.where("name iLIKE ?", "%#{ search_keyword }%")
end

@products = @products.order(:id)
```

Search by using this URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/products/?search=U-235`. In this case, I'm searching for U-235, but you can search for anything, and the results will be ordered by id.




### Change the index action to allow the user to see products in order of price, lowest to highest (using params “sort” equal to “price”).

```ruby
@products = Product.all

search_keyword = params[:search]
if search_keyword
  @products = @products.where("name iLIKE ?", "%#{ search_keyword }%")
end

sort_attribute = params[:sort]
if sort_attribute
  @products = @products.order(sort_attribute)  ## This allows us to sort by any attribute! This is better than muy solution of putting price directly in there. I should put this into my mini capstone.
else
  @products = @products.order(:id)
end

```

Search by using this URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/products/?search=U&`.



### Change the index action to allow the user to see products in order of price, highest to lowest (using params “sort” equal to “price” and params “sort_order” equal to “desc”).

```ruby
@products = Product.all

search_keyword = params[:search]
if search_keyword
  @products = @products.where("name iLIKE ?", "%#{ search_keyword }%")
end

sort_attribute = params[:sort]
sort_order = params[:sort_order]
if sort_attribute
  # @products = @products.order(sort_attribute: :sort_order) ## This will NOT work, because ruby intreprets this as a key value pair, where sort_attribute is the key. You can't write this in Javascript notation, you need to use the hash rocket.
  @products = @products.order(sort_attribute => sort_order)  # Problem. This will break if price is nil, so we need to add an elsif.
elsif 
  @prodcuta = @products.order(sort_attribute)
else
  @products = @products.order(:id)
end
```




### Change the index action to allow the user to display all products under $2.00 or some other price of your choosing (using params “discount” equal to “true”).

```ruby
@products = Product.all

search_keyword = params[:search]
if search_keyword
  @products = @products.where("name iLIKE ?", "%#{ search_keyword }%")
end

discount = params[:discount]

if discount
  @products = @products.where("price < ?", 10)  # We are writing in SQL, not in ruby. So we can ONLY use what's available in the database, and NOTHING else. So we can't access the is_discounted? method from our model.
end

sort_attribute = params[:sort]
sort_order = params[:sort_order]
if sort_attribute
  # @products = @products.order(sort_attribute: :sort_order) ## This will NOT work, because ruby intreprets this as a key value pair, where sort_attribute is the key. You can't write this in Javascript notation, you need to use the hash rocket.
  @products = @products.order(sort_attribute => sort_order)  # Problem. This will break if price is nil, so we need to add an elsif.
elsif 
  @prodcuta = @products.order(sort_attribute)
else
  @products = @products.order(:id)
end
```

## Cows and Farmers

Everyone loves magical Trevor because the tricks that he does are ever so clever. We're going to explore database management using data from farmers and cows.

### Associations

Associations (term of art) are links between two tables. Associations are a way to DRY up your database. If you have one table for cows, and each cow has a farmer, you need to repeat that farmer's info for every cow she owns. So, instead, we create a farmers table, and associate each cow with a farmer. Then, we only have to have each farmer's information in the database once. This has the added benefit that if we need to update the farmer's information, we only have to change one databsase entry.

Normalization is breaking a table into two or more other tables so you can reduce the table to unique instances.

**Primary Key:** The cow's ID number

**Foreign Key:** The farmer's ID number. Referring to another table by ID is the most protective way to associate. You don't want to reference the farmer's name because there can be duplicates. IDs are best practice (unique). _Think:_ it's referencing a foreign table. This is called a **one-to-many relationship.**

#### Brand the cow not the farmer:

In our example: Cows **belongs to** farmers. Cows have the primary key, farmers have the foreign id. The farmer **has many** cows. The foreign key always goes to the entity that **has many** of the other. It's useful to think of the foreign key as _branding_. It doesn't make sense to brand the farmer with the cow's symbol. You'll run out of room to brand, it'll be hard to find the brand you need on that farmer. I'm taking this analogy kinda far, but you'll get it.

* Brand = belongs to

** Note: You're probably going to have to go through this lecture one more time.**


In a has_many association (shortcut), cows _must_ be plural. The id must be the name of the class + _ + id, e.g., farmer_id if the class is Farmer. The shortcut for this is **belongs_to**

* Assumes (1) we're passing in a singular (not plural) symbol, (2) #farmer is a method name, (3) the farmer class exists, (4) we want a single Farmer Object, (5) that this cow has a farmer_id.



## Back to Mini Capstone. We're going to add suppliers for our products.

We want to add suppliers with name, e-mails, and phone numbers.

```bash
rails g model Supplier name email phone_number
```

Check `db/migrate/` for the last migration file tom make sure you typed it all correctly.

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

Product is going to get the branding, because product belongs to a single supplier.

```bash
rails g migration AddSupplierIdToProducts supplier_id:integer
```

Check the migration file, if it's all good, migrate. THen we're going to create 

```bash
rake db:migrate
rails c
```

```ruby
Supplier.create(name: "Dr. Bascom's Chemical Extravaganza", phone_number: "555-555-2455", email: "drbascom@nyu.edu")
Supplier.create(name: "Fireworks Fireworks Fireworks", phone_number: "310-555-5455", email: "fireworksfireworks@fireworks.edu")
Supplier.create(name: "The Black Market", phone_number: "212-534-2455", email: "dreadpiraterobers@silkroad.com")
```

Now we need to document the relationship between the suppliers and the products. We're also going to do this in the rails console. They already have 

First: the long way.

```ruby 
 product = Product.find(1)
 product.update(supplier_id: 2)
# Then go through each and every product, and assign them an id.
```

Now: the short (magic) way. 

```ruby 
# Collect all of the product IDs at once, using the method "pluck"
# Supplier.all.pluck(:id) # equivalent to the line below
supplier_ids = Supplier.pluck(:id)
products = Product.all 
products.each do { |product| product.update(supplier_id: supplier_ids.sample) }

```

Go to your products model `products.rb`, we're going to add this method:

```ruby
def supplier
  Supplier.find_by(id: self.supplier_id)
  # Supplier.find(supplier_id) # equivalent
end
```

Go to your supplier model `supplier.rb`, we're going to add this method:

```ruby
def products
  # Product.find_by(supplier_id: self.id)  # Would give us one product back that satisfies the critera.
  Product.where(supplier_id: self.id)  # Gives all prodcuts back that satisfy the critera.
end
```

```bash
rails c
```

```ruby
product = Product.find(2)
product.supplier_id
product.supplier

supplier = Supplier.first
supplier.products

```

We need to change the update and create actions, and their views.

In the contoller:

```ruby
def create
    @product = Product.new(
                            name: params[:name],
                            price: params[:price],
                            image_url: params[:image_url],
                            description: params[:description],
                            supplier_id: params[:supplier_id]
                            )
    
    if @product.save
      render 'show.json.jbuilder'
    else
      render json: { errors: @product.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  def update
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])

    @product.name = params[:name] || @product.name
    @product.price = params[:price] || @product.price
    @product.image_url = params[:image_url] || @product.image_url
    @product.description = params[:description] || @product.description
    @product.in_stock = params[:in_stock] || @product.in_stock
    @product.supplier_id = params[:supplier_id] || @product.supplier_id

    if @product.save
      render 'show.json.jbuilder'    
    else
      render json: { errors: @product.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
  ```

  Add `json.supplier_id product.supplier_id` to views product partial:

```ruby
  json.id product.id
  json.name product.name

  json.price product.price
  json.tax product.tax
  json.total product.total

  json.image_url product.image_url
  json.description product.description
  json.is_discounted product.is_discounted?
  json.in_stock product.in_stock?
  json.supplier_id product.supplier_id

  json.formatted do
    json.price number_to_currency(product.price)
    json.tax number_to_currency(product.tax)
    json.total number_to_currency(product.total)
  end
```

```bash
rails g controller suppliers

# we shouldn't have done that. so we can destroy it.

rails destroy controller suppliers

rails g controller api/suppliers
```

create `_supplier.json.jbuilder` and add this:

```ruby
json.id supplier.id
json.name supplier.name
json.email supplier.email
json.phone_number supplier.phone_number
```

Back to our `_products` partial:

```ruby
  json.id product.id
  json.name product.name

  json.price product.price
  json.tax product.tax
  json.total product.total

  json.image_url product.image_url
  json.description product.description
  json.is_discounted product.is_discounted?
  json.in_stock product.in_stock?
  json.supplier_id product.supplier_id

  json.supplier do
    json.partial! product.supplier, partial: 'api/suppliers/supplier', as: :supplier   ## Start from views folder
  end

  json.formatted do
    json.price number_to_currency(product.price)
    json.tax number_to_currency(product.tax)
    json.total number_to_currency(product.total)
  end
```

This isn't working. Talk to Josh about it.
