# Things and stuff!! Mostly things, but also stuff.

## PostgreSQL Searches - In Class Example

### Get all info about employees whose last names begin with “Z”.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE "Z%"
```

Also works:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name SIMILAR TO "Z%";
```

### Get the first name and last name of employees whose last names begin with “Mi”.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE "Mi%";
```

Also works:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name >= "Mi"
AND last_name < "Mj";
```

Also works:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name ~ '^Mi';  # ^ is start of string; ~ to start a regular expression
```

Also works:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE substr(last_name, 1, 2) = 'Mi';
```

### Get first name,  last name, and birthday of 5 oldest employees.

```SQL
SELECT first_name, last_name, birth_date
FROM employees
ORDER BY birth_date
LIMIT 5;
```

### Get all info about the 5 most recent hires.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Get all info about 5 most recent female hires.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE gender = 'F'          # Note - This doesn't work if you put WHERE after ORDER BY
ORDER BY hire_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Get all the info on all employees whose first name is Mario or Luigi.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Mario' 
OR first_name = 'Luigi';
```

### Get only the first and last name of employees without the the last name “Aingworth.”

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name != 'Aingworth';
```

Also works

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name NOT IN ('Aingworth', 'Facello');    ### Can also add another name in there
```

Also works

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name NOT LIKE 'Aingworth';    ### Can also add another name in there
```

### Get all the info on employees whose first name is Arif, but only those hired between 1988 and 1992.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Arif'
AND hire_date BETWEEN '1987-12-31' AND '1993-01-01';
```

Also Works:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Arif'
AND hire_date > '1987-12-31' 
AND hire_date < '1993-01-01';
```

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Arif'
AND hire_date >= '1988-01-01' 
AND hire_date <= '1992-12-31';
```

### How many employees were making over $100,000 a year on June 24, 1992? Return only a number.

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM salaries
WHERE salary > 100000
AND from_date <= '1992-06-24'  # They were hired before this date
AND to_date >= '1992-06-24'
```

## SQL And Rails

<<Lots to add from Josh's presentation here>>


```SQL
SELECT *
FROM recipes
ORDER BY 'ID'
LIMIT 1;
```


## Back to the Cookbook App

In your `recipes_controller.rb`:

We're going to change the @recipes to use SQL. First example we're going to pull all recipes with Sandwich in them.

```ruby
class Api::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  
  def index
    @recipes = Recipe.where("title iLIKE ?", "%sandwich%")
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end
```

This will get you all entries with the chef 

```ruby
class Api::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  
  def index
    @recipes = Recipe.where("chef iLIKE ?", "%josh%")
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end
```

Now, let's use some string parameters to search dynamically in the url bar. Now we're going to replace @recipes with the new value that will be taken from params. 

```ruby
class Api::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  
  def index
    @recipes = Recipe.all

    search_terms = params[:search]
    if search_terms
      @recipes = Recipe.where("title iLike ?", "%#{search_terms}%")
    end

    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end
```

Now (assuming your rails server is on), if you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/recipes/?search=sand` you'll find every recipe where the title includes "sand".

The first time you actually access the data is in the view. Rails doesn't make the query until the last moment that it can. So you can chain multipe queries in our controller, and Rails will handle it by making the query at the end, when it's done in views. Watch us chain a few together here:


```ruby
class Api::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  
  def index
    @recipes = Recipe.all

    search_terms = params[:search]
    if search_terms
      @recipes = @recipes.where("title iLike ?", "%#{search_terms}%")
    end
    @recipes = @recipes.order(:id => :asc) # If we don't pass a search term (so the if statement doesn't run), this will run on the list of all receipes. If the if statement is triggered, this will only sort the entries that were grabbed by the search.

    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end
```
