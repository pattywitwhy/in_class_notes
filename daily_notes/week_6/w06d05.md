# Vue.js; Installing/Using Javascript Packages with Webpack

## Example: Installing the math.js package 

First, we need to install webpack. But, we only want it (webpack? #askjosh) to run in development mode. When it goes to production, we don't want to use it because it'll slow down the page loading, which you don't want.

```bash
npm install webpack webpack--cli --save-dev
```

If you look, you'll see this added to the `package.json` file. 

Next: 

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack index.js
```

This takes all the different Javascript files and puts them all into one file. The folder `dist` is created, with `main.js` inside. `main.js` has a bunch of javascript. It combined `moment.js` with the `index.js` that we wrote.

Recall, our `index.html` file looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Modern JS</title>
  <script src="node_modules/moment/moment.js"></script>
  <script src="node_modules/mathjs/index.js"></script>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello From HTML</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

And in `index.js`, we need to add the line `var moment = require('moment');`

```js
var moment = require('moment');
var math = require('mathjs');

console.log("Hello, from Javascript");
var datetime = moment().startOf('day').fromNow();
console.log(datetime);

```

Now that we've installed webpack, we can trim down our `index.html` file. We don't need to write a require line for each script anymore. We only need to reference `main.js`, not the individual packages, since their code is incorporated into `main.js`. 

Note: 

* webpack is the Javascript equivalent of Bundler in Ruby 
* Node module and packages are the same thing. They are just JS syntax for libraries.

We can cut our `index.html` down to just this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Modern JS</title>
  <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello From HTML</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, we're going to install `math.js`, and then re-build `main.js`:

```bash
npm install mathjs --save
./node_modules/.bin/webpack index.js --mode=development
```

Now, you can load the html page, check the console, and complex math functions will work properly. Hooray!

## Creating a Configuration File

Create a file `webpack.config.js` in the root directory of your app, and add the following lines:

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    publicPath: 'dist'
  }
};
```

Now we can run webpack without the index.js or `--mode-development`:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

It still works, because the config file tells webpack to look at `index.js` and to run in development mode.

## Using Babble 

Back in 2015, an update to Javascript called ES6 was released. ES6 added functionality to JS, which hadn't been updated in many (20?) years. This is great for developers who want to add functionality to their websites, but no-so-great for people who still run Windows 95 (who may want to visit your website). So, developers used Babble to to translate back to prior versions of Javascript.

ES2015 (formerly ES6) is now covered by all browsers. A new version of ES is generally released every year. We're on ES2019 now, but none of the major browsers support it yet. So if you want to incorporate ES2019 into a site you're developing, you need something like Babble to translate backwards.

Let's install it:

```bash
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader --save-dev
```

Then make sure your `webpack.config.js` looks like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    publicPath: 'dist'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

Then run webpack:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

## Making Running Javascript/Webpack Less Annoying

How we've been running webpack is annoying. So let's set it up so it automatically runs whenever you make a change to your code, and you don't have to restart your server every time you tweak it.

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --progress --watch
```

In `package.json`, add two lines to where in the "scripts" key:

```json
  "name": "modern_javascript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack --progress --mode=production",
    "watch": "webpack --progress --watch",
    "server": "webpack-dev-server --open"
  },
```

Now if we want to have this run continually while developing (so we don't have to rebuild every time we make a change), you can use this command:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Hooray! In addition to updating your information every time you change your javascript file, you can also run a server that automatically updates your browser every time you update your javascript file.

To do so, run this:

```bash
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
npm run server
```

Now, if you make any changes to `index.js`, everything will update automatically! The server is located at `localhost:8080`, and you can follow along jovially with your updates in real time.

## Vue.js - Javascript Front-End Framework

### Common Frameworks
(Opinion's about frameworks are Josh's.)

* Backbone.js 
* Angular.js (front end) (by Google)
  * This used to be taught in Actualize
  * It was a nice framework, but then react came out and Angular changed it's philosophy. Now it's bulky and the updates come out too quickly; the code ends up being brittle. So Actualize moved away from teaching it.
* React.js (Facebook)
  * It's a bad frontend framework to start with. It can be counterintuitive ("flips your brain inside out"), but once you do get used to it's actually really nice.

### Vue.js

A much smaller, lighter framework. It doesn't have the backing of a huge company like Google or Facebook--it's really just one guy's project. Despite this, it's doing very well, and Rails considers VueJS to be one of the only 3 viable frameworks (the other two being Angular & React). 

**Advantages**:

* Speed
  * You don't have to write it all
  * Uses common conventions
* Consistency
  * Others have already tested it out and found bugs
* Easy to find documentation about it

**Disadvantages**:

* It's hard to change
* More specialized, less customizable
* bulky

### Installing Vue.js

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

(This `-g` in `npm install -g @vue/cli` installs it on the entire computer, not just one directory.)

This failed. But let's change the ownership! Then we can actually run it. We are going to change the ownership to the current user:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

Now, with the proper permissions, it installs correctly. Notice how Josh didn't go straight to `sudo !!`, to reduce the risk to our computers.

### Example: Adding Vue.js to the Cookbook App

We're going to build a Vue.js app. In `~/actualize`

```bash
vue create cookbook_vue_app
cd cookbook_vue_app
npm run serve
```

Next, select the features that we want using "manually select features". We want: Babel & Router. Use history mode. Place config for Babel, PostCSS, etc. in `package.json`. Then save this as a preset for future use. We saved it as Actualize. Then you can see your first Vue app by opening `http://localhost:8080/`. 

Then install Vue.js devtools chrome extension (google it).

Open the `cookbook_vue_app` in sublime. We're going to be looking at `src/views/home.vue` today and Monday. We're going to be dealing with this file for the next little while.

Paste the following into `home.vue`.

```html
<template>              <!-- This is where your html (normally in between body tags) goes -->
  <div class="home">
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>    
    <p>{{ message2 }}</p>
    <p>{{ message3 }}</p>
    <p>{{ message4 }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<style>                 /*This is where your CSS goes*/
</style>

<script>                // This is where your Javascript goes
export default {
  data: function() {
    return {
      message: "OMG We made a Vue App!!",
      message2: "... or did we?",
      message3: "...",
      message4: "... yes we did."
    };
  },
  created: function() {},
  methods: {}
};
</script>
```

Now head back to bash and turn on the server with `npm run serve`.

The `{{ message }}` is similar to ERB syntax. It's the javascript equivalent. You can put runable javascript code into the `{{ }}`s and it'll run. Hooray! You can see your changes to the message at `http://localhost:8080/`. 

```bash
npm run serve
```
