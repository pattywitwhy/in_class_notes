# Welcome to mooooooore coding.

There are no symbols in Javascript.

### Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2} Someone just bought two chairs. Change the hash such that the chair amount is 3. The final result should be: {chair: 3, table: 2}, first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
funiture_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
funiture_amounts[:chair] = 3
p funiture_amounts
```

```js
var funitureAmounts = {chair: 5, table: 2};
// All of these work:
// funitureAmounts["chair"] = 3;
// funitureAmounts["chair"] -= 2;
funitureAmounts.chair = 3;
console.log(funitureAmounts);
```

The `.chair` syntax is kind of a built-in reader and writer method that JS already has in pace. If you call a reader method for a that doesn't exist, you'll get `undefined` returned. It's one of seven falsey values in JS. Some others are: `NaN`, `0`, `null`, `false`, `""` (empty strings).

### Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2} You received 7 desks to sell. Change the hash to include desks. The final result should be: {chair: 5, table: 2, desk: 7}, first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
item_amounts[desk] = 7
p item_amounts
```

```js
item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2};
item_amounts.desk = 7;
console.log(item_amounts.desk);
```

### Write a method that accepts a number and returns its factorial. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120., first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
def factorial(number)
  product = 1
  while number > 0
    product *= number
    number -= 1
  end
product
end
```

```js
function factorial(number) {
  var product = 1;
  while (number > 0) {
    product *= number;
    number--;
  }
  return product;
}
console.log(factorial(5));
```

 ### Write a method that accepts two arrays of numbers, and prints the sum of every combination of numbers from first and second array.  For example, if the method receives [1, 5, 10] and [100, 500, 1000], the method should print a list: 101, 501, 1001, 105, 505, 1005, 110, 510, 1010., first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
def all_combinations(numbers_1, numbers_2)
  combos = []
  numbers_1.each do |number_1|
    numbers_2.each do |number_2|
      combos << number_1 + number_2
    end
  end
  combos
end
```

```js
function allCombinations(numbers_1, numbers_2) {
  var combos = [];
  numbers_1.forEach( function(number_1) {
    numbers_2.forEach( function(number_2) {
      combos.push(number_1 + number_2)
    });
  });
  return combos
}
```


## Translating from JS to Ruby
See Josh's cheat sheet.

`$ node` is the JS equivalent of `$ irb`. You can quit out of node by typing `.exit`. 

Javascript handles random numbers differently. The function you use is `Math.random();`, which generates a random numbers between 0 and 1. So, for example

* To get the numbers 1â€“10, execute `Math.random() * 10 + 1;`. If you want the integers, round the numbers using `Math.floor`, like so: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);` 

## For Loops in Javascript

For loops are very similar to a while loop. First, check out the while looop in JS:

```js
var i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

Now check out some code with the same functionality in a for loop:

```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

```

Note that `var i = 0` runs once before the loop begins, and the `i++` runs once each time at the end of the loop. 

## In-class exercise: Convert Ruby to Javascript
Ruby:

```ruby 
# Equality check
x = 10
if x == "10"
  puts "equal"
else
  puts "not equal"
end
```
Javascript:

```js
var x = 10;
if ( x === "10") {
  console.log("equal");
} else {
  console.log("not equal");
}
```

Ruby:

```ruby 
# Falsey values
x = 3
if nil
  x = x + 1
end
if false
  x = x + 1
end
if 0
  x = x + 1
end
if !!""
  x = x + 1
end
p x
```

Javascript:

```js
var x = 3; 
if (null) {
  x++;
}
if (false) {
  x++;
}
if (0) {
  x++;
}
if (!!"") {
  x++;
}
console.log(x);
```

Ruby

```ruby
# Functions
def print_lyrics
  puts "Now this is a story all about how"
  puts "My life got flipped turned upside down"
  puts "And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there"
  puts "I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air"
end

print_lyrics
```

Javascript:

```js
function printLyrics() {
  console.log("Now this is a story all about how");
  console.log("My life got flipped turned upside down");
  console.log("And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there");
  console.log("I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air");
}
printLyrics();
```

Ruby:

```ruby
# Scope
x = 100
def add_one(num)
  x = 1
  return num + x
end
puts x           #=> 100
puts add_one(5)  #=> 6
puts x           #=> 100
```

Javascript:

```js
var x = 100;
def addOne(num) {
  x = 1;
  return num + 1;
}
console.log(x);
console.log(addOne(5));
console.log(x);
```

This is an important distinction. In Javascript, where you define a variable determines what scope it has. If you define it outside of the function, it's an "outside-the-function" variable. It's accessible inside of the function, where it's the same x. So when you redefine it in the function, it redefines it at the top-level as well. BUT we can change this scope!

```js
var x = 100;
def addOne(num) {
  var x = 1;
  return num + 1;
}
console.log(x);
console.log(addOne(5));
console.log(x);
```

By adding `var` to `x = 1;`, you now created a new variable inside the function, which is only in that scope, not the top-level scope. So if we run it again, we'll get the same result as ruby. It doesn't affect the top-level definition of `var x = 100`. This is very similar to an instance method in ruby, allowing us to access the variable in a different scope.

Ruby:

```ruby
# JavaScript objects vs. Ruby classes
class Boat
  attr_reader :name, :color
  attr_writer :color

  def initialize(name, color, price)
    @name = name
    @color = color
    @price = price
  end

  def color=(new_color)
    @color = new_color
  end
end

boat = Boat.new("S. S. Minnow", "white", 20000 )
p boat
p boat.name
boat.color = "red"
p boat.color
```

Javascript:

```js
var boat = {
            name: "S. S. Minnow",
            color: "white",
            price: 20000
            }

console.log(boat);
console.log(boat.name);
boat.color = "red";
console.log(boat.color);
```

Look at this:

```js
function hungry() {
  console.log("yes");
}
```

We can rewrite this in First citizen syntax, like this:

```js
var hungry = function() {
  console.log("yes");
};
```

Now let's add a behavior for the boat. We can somehow add a function to the object when we define it. Check out adding a horn. This is a _method_ because it's attached to an object.

```js
var boat = {
            name: "S. S. Minnow",
            color: "white",
            price: 20000,
            horn: function() {
              console.log("Honk!!!")
             }
            };

boat.horn();
```

And it honks!

## In-class Exercise: Converting Ruby to JS

```ruby
# Write a function that accepts an array of strings and returns a new array containing every other string from the original array. For example, if the input is ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"], the output should be ["a", "c", "e"].

def select_even_items(strings)
  result = []
  index = 0
  strings.each do |string|
    if index % 2 == 0
      result << string
    end
    index = index + 1
  end
  result
end
p select_even_items(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"])
```

Javascript Equivalent:

```js
```

```ruby
# Write a method that accepts one argument - an array of numbers. The method should return the greatest number. For example, if the input is [5, 4, 8, 1, 2], the output should be 8.

def max(numbers)
  current_max = numbers[0]
  numbers.each do |number|
    if number > current_max
      current_max = number
    end
  end
  current_max
end
p max([5, 4, 8, 1, 2])
```

Javascript Equivalent:

```js
```

```ruby
# Write a method that accepts a number and returns its factorial. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

def factorial(number)
  result = 1
  current_number = number
  number.times do
    result = result * current_number
    current_number = current_number - 1
  end
  result
end
p factorial(5)
```

Javascript Equivalent:

```js
```

```ruby
# Write a method that accepts one argument - an array of numbers that are in ascending order. The method that returns a new array with the same values in descending order. However, do not use the "reverse" method built in to Ruby.

def descending(numbers)
  result = []
  index = numbers.length - 1
  numbers.length.times do
    result << numbers[index]
    index = index - 1
  end
  result
end
p descending([1, 3, 5, 7])
```

Javascript Equivalent:

```js
```

```ruby
# Write a method that accepts two arrays of numbers, and returns an array of every sum of every combination of single numbers from first and second array. For example, if the method receives [1, 5, 10] and [100, 500, 1000], the method should return this array: [101, 501, 1001, 105, 505, 1005, 110, 510, 1010].

def sum_combinations(numbers1, numbers2)
  result = []
  numbers1.each do |number1|
    numbers2.each do |number2|
      result << number1 + number2
    end
  end
  result
end
p sum_combinations([1, 5, 10], [100, 500, 1000])
```
