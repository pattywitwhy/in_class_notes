## Javascript In-Class Exercises

### Write a function that takes in a string and returns the reverse.

```js
function reverseString(string) {
  var reverse = "";
  for (var i = string.length - 1; i > -1; i--) {
    reverse += string[i]
  }
  return reverse;
}
console.log(reverseString("Hello"));
```

### Write a function that takes a string as input and counts the number of times a specific string appears

```js
function countLetters(string, letter) {
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    if(string[i] === letter) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

console.log(countLetters("abcdeabcdeabcde", "b"));
```

### Write a linear search algorithm, which searches an array for a particular element. If the element exists, it returns the index of the first instance. If the item doesn't appear in the array, the function returns `null`.

```js
function linearSearch(array, target) {
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] === target) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return null;
}
console.log(linearSearch([1,2,4,5,2,4,"apple"], "apple"));
```

I also tried to do this with an each loop, but interestingly you can't break out of an Each loop in JS. So, I used a similar function to `forEach` called [`some()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some). The `some()` method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

Check it out:

```js
function linearSearch(array, target) {
  var targetIndex = null;
  var i = 0;

  array.some( function(element) {
    if(element === target) {
      targetIndex = i;
      return i;
    }
    i++
  });
  return targetIndex
}
console.log(linearSearch([1,2,4,5,2,4,"apple"], "apple"));
```

I'm suspicious that I'm not using the function the way it was intended, but it worked.

## Cookbook App Example: Javascript Demonstration

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/robots.txt`, and you'll see your current robots.txt. That file is where you let web scrapers know what parts of your website you are allowing them to scrape, and what parts you do not. Do not rely on this, because shady web crawlers will ignore the `robots.txt` and scrape your data anyway. But, large corporations (e.g., Google), will respect your `robots.txt`. 

In the `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Index</title>
  <script src=“https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js“></script>
  <script src=“index.js” defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Raw Eggs</h1>
    <h5>Prep Time: 5 Minutes</h5>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This works, but it's not dynamic. We want our code to be dynamic, and we can get it there by introducing Javascript. Create an `index.js` in the `public` folder, and add the following code:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes");
console.log(response.data);
```

We can't seem to access the data. **Why can't we access the data?** An Ajax request is asynchronous javascript and xml. Axios is a newer tool than ajax, so we'll be using it. An asynchronous request is a different from a top-down request (like ruby). JS is asynchronous. 

## Asynchronous Javascript

In ruby:

```ruby
def first_task
  puts "First Task Complete!"
end

first_task
```

In Javascript:

```js
function firstTask() {
  console.log("First Task Complete!");
}

firstTask();
```

So far, they're exactly the same. Now let's see what happens when we add sleep in both ruby and JS.

In ruby:

```ruby
def first_task
  puts "First Task Complete!"
end

sleep 2
first_task
```

In Javascript:

```js
function firstTask() {
  console.log("First Task Complete!");
}
setTimeOut(firstTask, 2000);
```

The first argument `setTimeOut` is the name of the function (don't include `()` in the function name), and the second argument is the number of miliseconds to wait. Do the functions still run identically? Yes.

Now let's add a second task:

In ruby:

```ruby
def first_task
  puts "First Task Complete!"
end

def second_task
  puts "Second Task Complete!!"
end

sleep 2
first_task
second_task
```

In Javascript:

```js
function firstTask() {
  console.log("First Task Complete!");
}

function secondTask() {
  console.log("Second Task Compete!!")
}


setTimeout(firstTask, 2000);
secondTask();
```

This time, ruby waits two seconds, then prints "First Task Complete!" & "Second Task Compete!!" in sequence.

Javascript immediately prints "Second Task Compete!!", and then two seconds later prints "First Task Complete!". Javascript has a queuing function where it sets aside functions that will take a while to run, and then it immediately executes the other functions.

### Exercise: Write JavaScript code using the setTimeout function to print 3 lines asynchronously. Use anonymous functions in your setTimeout calls. The output should do the following:

```
1. Wait 2 seconds
2. Print out “First task done!”
3. Wait another 2 seconds
4. Print out “Second task done!”
5. Wait another 2 seconds
6. Print out “Third task done!”
```

```js
function firstTask() {
  console.log("First Task done!");
}

function secondTask() {
  console.log("Second Task Done!")
}

function secondTask() {
  console.log("Third Task Done!")
}

setTimeout(firstTask, 2000);
setTimeout(secondTask, 4000);
setTimeout(thirdTask, 6000);

```

## Callbacks

This works fine if we know how long each task is going to take to run. This doesn't work so well with web requests, which can vary wildly. So we need to use a new tool: a callback. A callback says "I'll wait until this function is complete before I run." Here's how callbacks work:

In Javascript:

```js
setTimeout(function() { console.log("First Task done!");
  setTimeout(function() { console.log("Second Task Done!"); 
    setTimeout(function() { console.log("Third Task Done!"); 
    }, 2000);
  }, 2000);
}, 2000);

```

## Back to the Cookbook App:

This is why we couldn't access the data in our cookbook app's `index.js`, when we make the axios request. We need to modify it to evaluate in the right sequence. We'll use a new (to us) JS function: `then`.

In `index.js`:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes").then(function(response)); {
  console.log(response.data);
};
```

This returns the array of our recipes. If we ran `response.data[0]`, it would give us the first recipe.

Here's one advantage to JS's barrage of semicolons and curly braces: we can format `index.js` to make the function more readable:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var webpage = document;
});
```

This is called manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model). Let's focus in on a single div element:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var divElement = document.querySelector('div');    // we only want the first, otherwise we would use querySelectorAll
  divElement.innerHTML = "Hi Mom";
});
```

This replaces the contents of that div with "hi mom." We could also replace it with html:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var divElement = document.querySelector('div');   
  divElement.innerHTML = "<h1>Hi Mom.</h1>";
});
```

Here's where we're going with this:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var divElement = document.querySelector('div');
  var newContent = "";

  response.data.forEach(function(recipe) {
    newContent += '<h1>' + recipe.title + '</h1>'
  });    

  divElement.innerHTML = newContent;
});
```

Let's fill this out a little more:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var divElement = document.querySelector('div');
  var newContent = "";

  response.data.forEach(function(recipe) {
    newContent += '<h1>' + recipe.title + '</h1>'
    newContent += '<h4> Prep Time:' + recipe.formatted.prep_time + '</h4>'
    newContent += '<h2> Ingredients: </h2>'
    newContent += '<ul>'
    recipe.formatted.forEach(function(ingredient) {
      newcontent += '<li>' + ingredient + '</li>'
    });
    newContent += '</ul>'
    newContent += '<br>'
  });    

  divElement.innerHTML = newContent;
});
```

Now we're going to do some configuration.

```bash
mkdir modern_javascript
cd modern_javascript/
touch index.html
subl .
```

In `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Modern JS</title>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello From HTML</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Create an `index.js` file:

```js
console.log("Hello, from Javascript");
```

We're going to use an 

First, create an npm repository with `npm init`. 

```bash
npm init
```

Then press enter through all of the prompts. This builds a `package.json` file, which is now in your `modern_javascript` folder.

It looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "modern_javascript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Now we're going to create a package (library) called `moment.js`. The package lets you work with time in Javascript. You can find more information at `http://momentjs.com/`.  The problem is you can't just include this at the top of the library, you have to install it. npm is one of the ways to install it. There are many other ways (check their site, they list them). We're going to stick with npm for now, because it works well with views.

So, install it:

```bash
npm install moment --save
```

Now you've downloaded the moment library. And, our `package.json` automatically added in (yay!). See:

```json
{
  "name": "modern_javascript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "moment": "^2.24.0"
  }
}

```

It also created a folder `node_modules`, which contains a whole bunch of javascript that you now don't have to write. Since we've downloaded this module, we aren't vulnerable to anyone messing with a public version on a server. It's safely (I hope?) stored locally.

In `index.html`, add a script line so you can use moment:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Modern JS</title>
  <script src="node_modules/moment/moment.js"></script>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello From HTML</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In `index.js`:

```js
console.log("Hello, from Javascript");
var datetime = moment().startOf('day').fromNow();
console.log(datetime);
```

This tells us how long ago the day started.

In ruby:

```ruby
```

In Javascript:

```js
```
