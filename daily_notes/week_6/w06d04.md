# One day away from the halfway point

## Lots of practice exercises, to be added here later
(check practice.rb & practice.js, & add them later.)


## Something something javascript

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/robots.txt`, and you'll see your current robots.txt. That file defines what 

In your `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Index</title>
  <script src=“https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js“></script>
  <script src=“index.js” defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Raw Eggs</h1>
    <h5>Prep Time: 5 Minutes</h5>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This is fine, but it's not dynamic. We want our code to be dynamic. 

Now, create an `index.js`:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes");
console.log(response.data);
```

We can't seem to access the data. Why?

An Ajax request is asynchronous javascript and xml. Axios is a newer tool than ajax, so we'll be using it.

An asynchronous request is a different from a top-down request (like ruby). JS is asynchronous. 

Here's some examples of how JS runs differently from Ruby.

In ruby:

```ruby
def first_task
  puts "First Task Complete!"
end

first_task
```

In Javascript:

```js
function firstTask() {
  console.log("First Task Complete!");
}

firstTask();
```

So far, they're exactly the same. Now let's see what happens when we sleep it

In ruby:

```ruby
def first_task
  puts "First Task Complete!"
end

sleep 2
first_task
```

In Javascript:

```js
function firstTask() {
  console.log("First Task Complete!");
}
setTimeOut(firstTask, 2000);
```

The first argument of setTimeOut is the name of the function (no ()), and the second argument is the number of miliseconds to wait. Do the functions still run identically? Yes.

Now let's add a second task:

In ruby:

```ruby
def first_task
  puts "First Task Complete!"
end

def second_task
  puts "Second Task Complete!!"
end

sleep 2
first_task
second_task
```

In Javascript:

```js
function firstTask() {
  console.log("First Task Complete!");
}

function secondTask() {
  console.log("Second Task Compete!!")
}


setTimeout(firstTask, 2000);
secondTask();
```

This time, ruby waits two seconds, then prints "First Task Complete!" & "Second Task Compete!!".

Javascript immediately prints "Second Task Compete!!", and then two seconds later prints "First Task Complete!". Javascript has a queuing function where it sets aside functions that will take a while to run, and it immediately executes the other functions.

Exercise: Write JavaScript code using the setTimeout function to print 3 lines asynchronously. Use anonymous functions in your setTimeout calls. The output should do the following:

```
1. Wait 2 seconds
2. Print out “First task done!”
3. Wait another 2 seconds
4. Print out “Second task done!”
5. Wait another 2 seconds
6. Print out “Third task done!”
```

```js
function firstTask() {
  console.log("First Task done!");
}

function secondTask() {
  console.log("Second Task Done!")
}

function secondTask() {
  console.log("Third Task Done!")
}


setTimeout(firstTask, 2000);
setTimeout(secondTask, 4000);
setTimeout(thirdTask, 6000);

```

This works fine if we know how long each task is going to take to run. This doesn't work so well with web requests, which can vary wildly. So we need to use a new tool called a callback. A callback says "I'll wait until this function is complete before I run." We'll do it like this:

In Javascript:

```js
setTimeout(function() { console.log("First Task done!");
  setTimeout(function() { console.log("Second Task Done!"); 
    setTimeout(function() { console.log("Third Task Done!"); 
    }, 2000);
  }, 2000);
}, 2000);

```

This is why we couldn't access the data in our `index.js`. We need to modify it to evaluate in the right sequence.

In `index.js`:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes").then(function(response)); {
  console.log(response.data);
};
```

This returns the array of our recipes. If we asked for resonse.data[0], it would give us the first recipe.

There's another  `index.js`:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var webpage = document;
});
```

This is called manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model)

Let's focus in on a single div element:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var divElement = document.querySelector('div');    // we only want the first, otherwise we would use querySelectorAll
  divElement.innerHTML = "Hi Mom";
});
```

This replaces the contents of that div with "hi mom." We could also replace it with html:

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var divElement = document.querySelector('div');   
  divElement.innerHTML = "<h1>Hi Mom.</h1>";
});
```

Here's where we're going with this

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var divElement = document.querySelector('div');
  var newContent = "";

  response.data.forEach(function(recipe) {
    newContent += '<h1>' + recipe.title + '</h1>'
  });    

  divElement.innerHTML = newContent;
});
```


We could fill this out a little more

```js
var response = axios.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
  .then(function(response) {
  var divElement = document.querySelector('div');
  var newContent = "";

  response.data.forEach(function(recipe) {
    newContent += '<h1>' + recipe.title + '</h1>'
    newContent += '<h4> Prep Time:' + recipe.formatted.prep_time + '</h4>'
    newContent += '<h2> Ingredients: </h2>'
    newContent += '<ul>'
    recipe.formatted.forEach(function(ingredient) {
      newcontent += '<li>' + ingredient + '</li>'
    });
    newContent += '</ul>'
    newContent += '<br>'
  });    

  divElement.innerHTML = newContent;
});
```



Now we're going to do some configuration.

```bash
mkdir modern_javascript
cd modern_javascript/
touch index.html
subl .
```

In `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Modern JS</title>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello From HTML</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Create an `index.js` file:

```js
console.log("Hello, from Javascript");
```

We're going to use an 

First, create an npm repository with `npm init`. 

```bash
npm init
```

Press enter a bunch of times. This builds a package.json file, which is now in your `modern_javascript` folder.

It looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "modern_javascript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Now we're going to create a library called `moment.js`. This lets you work with time in Javascript. You can find more information at `http://momentjs.com/`.  The problem is you can't just include this at the top of the library, you have to install it. npm is one of the ways to install it. There are many other ways (see the site, they list them). We're going to stick with npm for now, because it works well with views.

So, install it:

```bash
npm install moment --save
```

Now you've downloaded the moment library. And, our package.json automatically added it (yay!). See:

```json
{
  "name": "modern_javascript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "moment": "^2.24.0"
  }
}

```

It also created a folder `node_modules`, which contains a whole bunch of javascript that you now don't have to write. Since we've downloaded this module, we aren't vulnerable to anyone messing with a public version on a server. It's safely (I hope?) stored locally.

In `index.html`, add a script line so you can use moment:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Modern JS</title>
  <script src="node_modules/moment/moment.js"></script>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello From HTML</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In `index.js`:

```js
console.log("Hello, from Javascript");
var datetime = moment().startOf('day').fromNow();
console.log(datetime);
```

This tells us how long ago the day started.

In ruby:

```ruby
```

In Javascript:

```js
```
