# Week 5, is this real life?

## Shopping cart example

We want to have many products in the shopping cart, without preventing that product from being added to other shopping carts at the same time.

Add a table called carted_products. It'll hold a status, belong to a user_id, a product_id, and order_id. When someone adds it to their cart, its status changes to `"carted"`. At this point we need to know what user the belongs to (id), what product has been selected (id), how many have been put in the cart (quantity). We can create an order based on these products, and give it an order id. Once the user completes the order, we'll want to change the the order status from `"carted"` to `"purchased"`. If someone deletes a carted order, we change the status to `"removed"`, and never create an order id for it (because it wasn't actually purchased). We still want to save this in our database because it's useful information which customers have added things to their cart but not pulled the trigger.

Warning: be careful with this association: user has_many orders. If a user has purchased things in the past, and you want to know how many active orders a person has, all of the user's past orders will show up. We're returning how many carted products are associated with that user, but it doesn't distinguish between the carted_products status (e.g., "purchased", "removed", or "carted").

### In-class exercise. Josh

#### 1) Create a new model called `CartedProduct`, which will have the attributes: user_id:integer product_id:integer quantity:integer status:string order_id:integer. We can also remove the product_id and quantity columns from orders.

```bash
rails g model CartedProduct user_id:integer product_id:integer quantity:integer status order_id:integer
rails g migration RemoveQuantityAndProductIdFromOrders product_id:integer quantity:integer
# Check your migration files here before migrating.
rake db:migrate

```

#### 2) Add the model associations to wire up all of these models to each other. (has_many, has_many :through, etc.)

#####   2.5) Remember that rails, by default does not let us create a row with an empty foreign key. When setting up the CartedProduct class make the belongs_to :order, optional: true

In the model `carted_product.rb`:

By default, rails doesn't let us have an empty association (associate with an object that hasn't been created yet). But order id may not be available, so we need to specify that it's optional.

```ruby
belongs_to :product
belongs_to :user
belongs_to :order, optional: true
```

In the model `order.rb`:

```ruby
belongs_to :user   ## This stays
## delete! the has_many products? I think? thing that used to be there?
has_many :carted_products
```

In the model `product.rb`:

Remove `has_many orders` because we just removed the foreign id. But we can add it back through the carted_products table.

```ruby
has_many :carted_products
has_many :orders, through: :carted_products
```

In the model `user.rb`:

Here, we do not associate order_id through carted_products because that will return too many objects, because order_id is not unique in the carted_products table. We keep the `has_many :orders`, because each order is unique in the users table.

```ruby
has_many :orders
has_many :carted_products
```

#### 3) Create a new controller called `api/carted_products`

```bash
rails g controller api/carted_products
```


```bash

```

```ruby

```
 
#### 4) Make a CartedProducts create action. Assume the user is sending the product id and quantity as the only parameters.

In routes.rb:

```ruby
post '/carted_products' => 'carted_product#create'
```

In the carted_product_controller:

When we created the carted_product migration file, we also could have set the default status to "created", assuming we were thinking ahead.

```ruby
before_action :authenticate_user

def create
  @carted_product = CartedProduct.new(
                                      product_id: params[:product_id],
                                      quantity: params[:quantity],
                                      status: "created",
                                      user_id: current_user.id
                                      )

  @carted_product.save
  render 'show.json.jbuilder'
end
```

Note that the current_user method is one we put into applications controller, which is inherited by every controller. Also note that we're omitting order_id from the @carted_product, because we have previously made it optional.

Also note that we want to add authentication to the create action, otherwise this will break when it calculated current_user.id for someone who is not logged in (can't run .id on nil).

In `show.json.jbuilder` inside the carted_product views:

```ruby
json.partial! @carted_product, partial: 'carted_product', as: :carted_product
```

In `_carted_product.json.jbuilder` partial inside the carted_product views:

```ruby
json.id carted_product.id
json.product_id carted_product.product_id
json.quantity carted_product.quantity
json.status carted_product.status
json.user_id carted_product.user_id
```
 
#### 5) Add an Insomnia request to add items to the cart (the carted products create action). (This will crash unless you provide the JWT in the headers...)

```bash
rails s

```

In Insomnia, first we'll need to login. Submit an email and password using POST on api/sessions. Then you copy the jwt token, and put it in the `Header`, with `Authentication` as `Bearer <jwt token>`.

Next, do another POST action on `api/carted_products`. Then I think I missed what's next? Or this was everything? I think this was everything?

 
#### 6) Make a CartedProducts index action. Note that this shouldn’t show ALL the carted products - it should only display the current user’s carted products that have a status of “carted”!

In the `routes.rb`, add this route:

```ruby
get '/carted_products' => '/carted_products#index'
```

We also want to authenticate before rendering the index action. 

In the `carted_products_controller.rb`:

```ruby
def index
  @carted_products = current_user.carted_products.where(status: "carted") # This is what we did, there are other solutions.

  # @carted_products = CartedProduct.where(user_id: current_user.id, status: "carted") # This is another way. Josh says he likes ours better, because this has more failure points. It's centered around a single object, which lets us be model centric, which would easily let us write a model method later, if we need to.
  render 'index.json.jbuilder'
end
```

We're going to make a model method for this user for what's in the user's cart.

In the model method `user.rb`, add this:

```ruby
def cart
  # current_user.carted_products.where(status: "carted")
  # = self.carted_products.where(status: "carted")
  # = 
  carted_products.where(status: "carted")
end
```

Now we go and update the index method in the carted_products controller:

```ruby
def index
  @carted_products = current_user.cart
  render 'index.json.jbuilder'
end
```

We still need to add a view for carted products. Create a file `index.json.jbuilder`:

```ruby
json.array! @carted_products, partial: "carted_product", as: :carted_product
```

Now in the carted product index view:

```ruby
json.id carted_product.id
json.product_id carted_product.id
json.quantity carted_product.quantity
json.status carted_product.status
json.user_id carted_product.user_id

json.product do
  json.partial! carted_product.product, partial: 'api/products/product', as: :product
end
```
 
#### 7) Add an Insomnia request to view the shopping cart (the carted products index action). (This will crash unless you provide the JWT in the headers...)

Make sure you're logged in, then do a post action to `http://localhost:3000/api/carted_products`, and send in `product_id` and `quantity`. Then, send a get request to the same url (`http://localhost:3000/api/carted_products`) to see the index, which will be all the products added to the cart of the user who is logged in. 
 
#### 8) Change the orders create action to do the following:



#####    i) Find all of the current user’s carted products that have a status of “carted”.

```bash

```

```ruby

```

#####   ii) Use that data to create a new row in the orders table, and save the user_id, subtotal, tax, and total.

We can now cut our Order create action down significantly in the orders_controller

```ruby
    @order = Order.new(
                      user_id: current_user.id,
                      subtotal: calculated_subtotal,
                      tax: calculated_tax,
                      total: calculated_total
                      )

### reduces to:

    @order = Order.new(
                      user_id: current_user.id,
                      )
```

Note that we're about to remove the happy-path/sad-path because it doesn't make sense in this case.

Hers's what the whole thing will look like after we mess with it:

```ruby 
class Api::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_admin, except: [:index, :show]
  
  def index
    @orders = current_user.orders
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def create
    carted_products = current_user.cart
    subtotal_sum = 0

    carted_products.each do |carted_product|
      subtotal_sum += carted_product.product.price * carted_product.quantity
    end

    calculated_tax = subtotal_sum * 0.09
    calculated_total = calculated_tax + calculated_subtotal

    @order = Order.new(
                      user_id: current_user.id,
                      subtotal: subtotal_sum,
                      tax: calculated_tax,
                      total: calculated_total
                      )
    
    if @order.save
      carted_product.each do |carted_product|
        carted_product.status = "purchased"
        carted_product.order_id = @order.id
        carted_product.save
      end
    end
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def show
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

Now we have to open our `_order` partial, to display our many carted products:

```ruby
json.id order.id
json.user_id order.user_id
json.quantity order.quantity
json.subtotal order.subtotal
json.tax order.tax
json.total order.total

json.carted_products do
  json.array! order.carted_products, partial: 'api/carted_products/carted_product', as: :carted_product 
end

json.formatted do
  json.subtotal number_to_currency(order.subtotal)
  json.tax number_to_currency(order.tax)
  json.total number_to_currency(order.total)
end
```

Send a GET action to `http://localhost:3000/api/orders/9` to pull up order #9.

Now we're going to create model methods to simplify that create action we just went through:

Open `carted_product.rb` and createa subtotal method:

```ruby
class CartedProduct < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :product
  belongs_to :order, optional: true

  def subtotal
    # self.product.price * self.quantity      # We can ditch self
    product.price * quantity    
  end
end
```

Head on over to the `order.rb` model:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :carted_products
  has_many :products, through: :carted_products

  def calculate_totals
    carted_products = current_user.cart
    subtotal_sum = 0

    carted_products.each do |carted_product|
      subtotal_sum += carted_product.subtotal
    end

    self.subtotal = subtotal_sum
    self.tax = @order.subtotal * 0.09
    self.total = @order.subtotal + @order.tax
  end
end

```

Let's clean this up by separating out the methods.

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :carted_products
  has_many :products, through: :carted_products

  def calculate_subtotal
    carted_products = user.cart
    subtotal_sum = 0

    carted_products.each do |carted_product|
      subtotal_sum += carted_product.subtotal
    end

    self.subtotal = subtotal_sum
  end

  def calculate_tax
    self.tax = @order.subtotal * 0.09
  end
  
  def calculate_total
    self.total = subtotal + tax
  end
  
  def calculate_totals
    calculate_subtotal
    calculate_tax
    calculate_total
  end
end

```


```ruby 
class Api::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_admin, except: [:index, :show]
  
  def index
    @orders = current_user.orders
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def create
    @order = Order.new(
                      # user_id: self.user.id # same as
                      user_id: user.id
                      # We did this because current_user is not available in the orders controller, so we have to use the belongs_to relationship with user. You can only use current_views in controller actions and views. Controllers are not a part of the web request cycle.
                      )

    carted_products = user.cart
    

    @order.calculate_totals
    @order.save
    
    carted_product.each do |carted_product|
      carted_product.status = "purchased"
      carted_product.order_id = @order.id
      carted_product.save
    end
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def show
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

Another iteration:

We can clean it up even more. We can add the save method to the calculate totals, so an order id is created. And this will allow us to create a new method as that updates each carted product in the user's cart to have a status of purchased, and an association with this order id.

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :carted_products
  has_many :products, through: :carted_products

  def calculate_subtotal
    carted_products = user.cart
    subtotal_sum = 0

    carted_products.each do |carted_product|
      subtotal_sum += carted_product.subtotal
    end

    self.subtotal = subtotal_sum
  end

  def calculate_tax
    self.tax = @order.subtotal * 0.09
  end
  
  def calculate_total
    self.total = subtotal + tax
  end


  # def associate_cart
  #   user.cart.each do |carted_product| 
  #     carted_product.status = "purchased"
  #     carted_product.order_id = id
  #     carted_product.save
  #   end 
  # end
### This can be written in one line:

  def associate_cart
    user.cart.each do |carted_product|
      carted_product.update( status: "purchased", order_id: id )    ### id is self.id.
    end
  end
  
  def calculate_totals
    save
    associate_cart
    calculate_subtotal
    calculate_tax
    calculate_total
  end
end

```

Our orders controller:

```ruby 
class Api::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_admin, except: [:index, :show]
  
  def index
    @orders = current_user.orders
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def create
    @order = Order.new(user_id: user.id)
    carted_products = user.cart
    
    @order.save
    @order.calculate_totals
    
    carted_product.each do |carted_product|
      carted_product.status = "purchased"
      carted_product.order_id = @order.id
      carted_product.save
    end
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def show
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

And another iteration:


```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :carted_products
  has_many :products, through: :carted_products

  def calculate_subtotal
    self.subtotal = carted_products.sum { |carted_product| carted_product.subtotal }
  end

  def calculate_tax
    self.tax = @order.subtotal * 0.09
  end
  
  def calculate_total
    self.total = subtotal + tax
  end

  def associate_cart
    user.cart.each do |carted_product|
      carted_product.update( status: "purchased", order_id: id )
    end
  end
  
  def calculate_totals
    save
    associate_cart
    calculate_subtotal
    calculate_tax
    calculate_total
    save
  end
end

```

Our orders controller:

```ruby 
class Api::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_admin, except: [:index, :show]
  
  def index
    @orders = current_user.orders
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def create
    @order = Order.new(user_id: user.id)
    @order.calculate_totals

    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def show
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

Last step: let's add an initialize method so it automatically calculates the totals


```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :carted_products
  has_many :products, through: :carted_products

  def initialize(input_options)
    super
    calculate_totals
  end

  def calculate_subtotal
    self.subtotal = carted_products.sum { |carted_product| carted_product.subtotal }
  end

  def calculate_tax
    self.tax = @order.subtotal * 0.09
  end
  
  def calculate_total
    self.total = subtotal + tax
  end

  def associate_cart
    user.cart.each do |carted_product|
      carted_product.update( status: "purchased", order_id: id )
    end
  end
  
  def calculate_totals
    save
    associate_cart
    calculate_subtotal
    calculate_tax
    calculate_total
    save
  end
end

```

Our orders controller is now about as clean as you can get it:

```ruby 
class Api::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_admin, except: [:index, :show]
  
  def index
    @orders = current_user.orders
    render 'index.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def create
    @order = Order.new(user_id: user.id)
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end

  def show
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])
    render 'show.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

Now we test it in Insomnia: 

* Add a product to cart
  * POST api/carted_products
    * product_id
    * quantity
  * GET api/orders

#####   iii) Modify all the rows from the carted_products table so that their status changes to “purchased” and that they are given the appropriate order_id.


 
#### 9) Add an Insomnia request to purchase all items in the shopping cart (the orders create action) (This will crash unless you provide the JWT in the headers...)

```bash

```

```ruby

```

#### 10) Add a carted products destroy action. This shouldn’t destroy the carted product - it should instead just update the status to “removed”.

This requres a route and an action.

Head to `routes.rb`:

```ruby
delete '/carted_products/:id' => 'carted_products#destroy'
```

Head to `carted_products_controller.rb`:

```ruby
def destroy
  carted_product = CartedProduct.find(params[:id])
  # carted_product.destroy                    # This is normally what you would do
  carted_product.update( status: "removed" )
  render json: { message: "Sucessfully removed carted product" }
end
```

```bash

```

```ruby

```

#### 11) Add an Insomnia request to remove an item from the cart (the carted products destroy action)
