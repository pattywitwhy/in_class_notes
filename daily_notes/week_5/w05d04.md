# Forms.

## Adding Form To Submit your website

We're going to do a new route: `/photos/new`, `photos#new`. This will give the user the ability to create a new object, by filling out a form. 

I did NOT get all of the information in this lecture. If I have time later, I should check out the video for this lecture and get the information that I missed.

Create a new file `form_example.html` in your `html_examples` 


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Form Example</title>
</head>
<body>

  <form method="post" action="/bricks">
    <div>
      Color: <input type="text" name="brick_color">    <!-- Name defines the key in your body params -->
    </div>
    <div>
      Brand: <input type="text" name="brick_brand">
    </div>
      Submit: <input type="submit" value="Create a Brick!">           <!-- value is what you want to appear on the button -->

  </form>

</body>
</html>

The form will allow you to submit a key_value pair like string-query params. If we put "red" and "chicago brick co", the output will be `brick_color=red&brick_brand=chicago brick co`. Neat!

More examples:

* `E-mail: <input type=“email” name=“email” multiple>`, when I enter `steve@glansberg.com`, the input was received as `“email”=steve@glansberg.com ` 
* `Password: <input type=“password” name=“pwd”>`, when I enter `hunter2`, the input was received as `“pwd”=hunter2` 
* When I add them both together, the input was received as `“email”=steve@glansberg.com&“pwd”=hunter2`
* When I add `<textarea cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>`, it changes the size of the submit box.
* When I add a select tag:

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <select name=“simple”>
    <option>Banana</option>
    <option>Cherry</option>
    <option>Lemon</option>
  </select>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

It adds a simple dropdown menu with options (1) Banana, (2) cherry, or (3) Lemon. When you submit with a banana checked, you get the output `“simple”=Banana`



* Then add ` <input type=“checkbox” checked name=“carrots” value=“carrots”>`, when I enter ``, the input was received as `` 

This should do checkboxes, but it isn't working for me.

* * Then add `<input type=“radio” checked name=“meal”>`, when I enter ``, the input was received as `` 

If radiobuttons are connected they all have the same name. Only one can be selected at at time. If you select one, then a different one, the first one you checked will unselect.

* * Then add `<input type=“datetime-local” name=“datetime”>`, when I enter ``, the input was received as `` 

## Back to the Cookbook App!

In `routes.rb`: 

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :client do
    get '/recipes' => 'recipes#index'
    get 'recipes/:id'=> 'recipes#show'
    get '/recipes/new' => 'recipes#new'
  end
end
```

In `recipes_controller.rb`: 

```ruby
class Client::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
    @recipes = response.parse
    render 'index.html.erb'
  end

  def show
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes/#{params[:id]}")
    @recipe = response.parse
    render 'show.html.erb'
  end

  def new
    render 'new.html.erb'
  end
end
```

In views, create a new file `new.html.erb`. Always include a `/` before your url, or it will break. Add the following:


<form action="/client/recipes" method="post">

  <div>
    Title: <input type="text" name="title">
  </div>

  <div>
    Prep Time: <input type="text" name="prep_time">
  </div>

  <div>
    Directions: <input type="text" name="directions">
  </div>

  <div>
    Image Url: <input type="text" name="image_url">
  </div>

  <input type="submit" name="Create Recipe">
</form>

When we navigate to `localhost:3001/clients/recipes/new`, it breaks and brings up the show action.

When we run it, it **breaks!** This is because ruby takes in the url and starts from the top of the routes to see if it matches anything. It matches 'recipes/:id' and things `new` is a string. So, we need to rearrange our routes and actions so this doesn't happen.

In `routes.rb`: 

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :client do
    get '/recipes' => 'recipes#index'
    get '/recipes/new' => 'recipes#new'
    get 'recipes/:id'=> 'recipes#show'
  end
end
```

In `recipes_controller.rb`: 

```ruby
class Client::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
    @recipes = response.parse
    render 'index.html.erb'
  end
  
  def new
    render 'new.html.erb'
  end

  def show
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes/#{params[:id]}")
    @recipe = response.parse
    render 'show.html.erb'
  end
end
```

We're also going to pair up the create and new routes.

New and create routes are paired together. You need to present a form (new) for the user to enter information. Then you need to submit it to the database to create the new product (create). Note also that the verbs line up as well. Get verbs are always displaying things. The other verbs are not displaying anything. 

Similarly, edit and update go together.

In `routes.rb`

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :client do
    get '/recipes' => 'recipes#index'
    get '/recipes/new' => 'recipes#new'
    post '/recipes' => 'recipes#create'
    get 'recipes/:id'=> 'recipes#show'
  end
end
```

In the recipes controller, add a create action:

```ruby
class Client::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
    @recipes = response.parse
    render 'index.html.erb'
  end
  
  def new
    render 'new.html.erb'
  end

  def create
    client_params = {
                    title: params[:title],
                    chef: params[:chef],
                    prep_time: params[:prep_time],
                    ingredients: params[:ingredients],
                    directions: params[:directions],
                    image_url: params[:image_url]
                    }

    # response = HTTP.post("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes", {form: client_params})
    # Equivalent to:
    response = HTTP.post(
                        "http://localhost:3000/api/recipes", 
                        form: client_params
                        )
  end

  def show
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes/#{params[:id]}")
    @recipe = response.parse
    render 'show.html.erb'
  end
end
```

Make a new file: 

create.html.erb

```erb
<h2>Successfully created a recipe</h2>
```

We also need to go into the application controller and uncomment `protect_from_forgery with: :null_session`.

We also need to modify the html form tags. Rails will only trust forms if they have a rails specific tag. Head on over to your erb file, and delete the html form tag and use a rails specific one:

```erb
<%= form_tag "/client/recipes", method: :post do %>

  <div>
    Title: <input type="text" name="title">
  </div>

  <div>
    Prep Time: <input type="text" name="prep_time">
  </div>

  <div>
    Directions: <input type="text" name="directions">
  </div>

  <div>
    Image Url: <input type="text" name="image_url">
  </div>

  <input type="submit" name="Create Recipe">
</form>

```

In the recipes controller, change your create action:

```ruby
class Client::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes")
    @recipes = response.parse
    render 'index.html.erb'
  end
  
  def new
    render 'new.html.erb'
  end

  def create
    client_params = {
                    title: params[:title],
                    chef: params[:chef],
                    prep_time: params[:prep_time],
                    ingredients: params[:ingredients],
                    directions: params[:directions],
                    image_url: params[:image_url]
                    }

    response = HTTP.post(
                        "http://localhost:3000/api/recipes", 
                        form: client_params
                        )

    recipe = response.parse
    redirect_to "/client/recipes/#{ recipe["id"] }"
  end

  def show
    response = HTTP.get("http://localhost:3000/api/recipes/#{params[:id]}")
    @recipe = response.parse
    render 'show.html.erb'
  end
end
```


### Exercise:

* Implement the frontend `new` route/action/view in your mini_capstone_client `client` namespace. Note: You won’t be able to test it until the next lesson
  * Make sure your api and client routes and controller actions are in order
    * shortcut to move lines in sublime
      *  highlight the area you want to move.
      *  press command + control with the up or down arrow key



In `routes.rb`

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :client do
    get "/products" => "products#index"
    get "/products/new" => "products#new"
    post "/products/create" => 'products/create'
    get "/products/:id" => "products#show"
  end
end
```

```erb
