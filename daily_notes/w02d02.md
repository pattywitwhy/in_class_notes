# W02D02 - Rails & Databases

Now we're going to add to our 5 steps:

1. Web request
2. API Route
3. API Controller (gets data from **model**)
4. API view
5. Web response

Models are a class that talks to databases.

_Examples_: Models can be users (facebook), posts (blog), tweets (twitter), or products (amazon).

## Cookbook Application 

We're going to be making a new rails application that we're going to use for 8 or 9 weeks. We'll be using this for a long time, so if it doesn't run __talk to Josh or Nick to resolve it__.

Here are (all) the steps:

```bash
rails new cookbook_app
cd cookbook_app
rake db:create
rails generate controller api/recipes         # Generate controller
rails generate model Recipe title:string chef:string ingredients:string directions:string image_url:string prep_time:integer     # Generate model. Model names should be singular, upper camel case. title can only create a string. We're basically setting the instance variables. We won't see them in our class, because rails is taking care of them for us. It gives us access to the reader and writer methods.
```
__Best practices__:

  * Don't destroy your rails applications if they're not working. Try to fix them. Unless you're really careful, you'll bog your computer down with a bunch of unncessary crap.
  * Never name two rails applications the same thing (this will cause their databases to be named the same thing, which is (apparently) bad).

You've created two files:
  
```bash
db/migrate/20190115154530_create_recipes.rb
app/models/recipe.rb
```

If you misspelled something in the rails generate model, this is your short chance to fix it by going into the migration file at `db/migrate/20190115154530_create_recipes.rb`. 

* Note that you should actually check this file to make sure it looks good! Once you migrate, you can't make any changes and you want to make sure it all looks good.

As a rule, attributes are held the in the database table, behaviors are held in the class (should this be model?). 

Continuing the example:

```bash
rake db:migrate
# If you got ===== lines, everything went swimmingly.
# If you go nothing, it didn't work.
# If everything blew up, you should maybe find an instructor.
```

#### CRUD - The four actions you can do with a piece of data.

1. Create
2. Read 
3. Update 
4. Destroy

* Note: any time you see db:<something>, you should use the command `rake` instead of `rails`, even if the cheat sheet says `rails`.

### Rails console
If you type `rails console` in bash, it will open up a console similar to irb, except that has everything from rails pre-loaded.


Type the following into the console:

```ruby
  recipe = Recipe.new(title: "Raw Egg", chef: "Josh", ingredients: "live chicken, pair of gloves", directions: "place gloves on hands, grip chicken's body, and squeeze gently", prep_time: 5)
```

This creates a Recipe object and stores it in the variable recipe. If you look at the output, you'll notice that some attributes have been created for you, but not assigned yet:  ID, created_at, and update_at. These will remain `nil` until we put them in the database. image_url is also blank.

Now type

```ruby
  recipe.save	 # You should see colored text if this works. This puts your recipe in the database.
  recipe		 # This will show us all the info about recipe, but now notice that created_at and updated_at are now filled in.
```

* Note that reader & writer methods have automatically been generated for all of the variables we've created. (Thank's Rails!)

To update an attribute using the automatically created writer methods:

```ruby
recipe.chef = "Bad Josh"
recipe.save
```

This updates the chef, then saves your changes to the database. 

Back to the console:

```ruby
recipe = Recipe.new(title: "Hand Sandwich", chef: "Josh", ingredients: "left hand, right hand, lettuce, mayo, avocado", directions: "Place left hand, palm up, ay ingredients on top of left hand, finish with right hand on top. Good night, Wisconsin!", prep_time: 15)
recipe.save
recipe = Recipe.new(title: "Cookies", chef: "Cookie Monster", ingredients: "cookie mix", directions: "cook, cookie, cookie, darn, should have bought eggs", prep_time: 380)
recipe.save
```

Now, we want to access all of the recipes that we've uploaded. To do so, we are going to refer to the recipe class and ask for `.all`.

```ruby
Recipe.all 
```

I received this response:

```ruby
<Recipe id: 1, title: "Raw Egg", chef: "Bad Josh", ingredients: "live chicken, pair of gloves", directions: "place gloves on hands, grip chicken's body, and sq...", image_url: nil, prep_time: 5, created_at: "2019-01-15 16:16:25", updated_at: "2019-01-15 16:16:25">, 
<Recipe id: 2, title: "Hand Sandwich", chef: "Josh", ingredients: "left hand, right hand, lettuce, mayo, avocado", directions: "Place left hand, palm up, ay ingredients on top of...", image_url: nil, prep_time: 15, created_at: "2019-01-15 16:19:25", updated_at: "2019-01-15 16:19:25">, 
<Recipe id: 3, title: "Cookies", chef: "Cookie Monster", ingredients: "cookie mix", directions: "cook, cookie, cookie, darn, should have bought egg...", image_url: nil, prep_time: 380, created_at: "2019-01-15 16:21:53", updated_at: "2019-01-15 16:21:53">]>
```

Notice that it's filling in the ids for you as you go along. Hooray. I cleaned the above text up for readability, but note that this is actually returned as an **array** of recipes. 


Here are a few more useful commands:

```ruby
Recipe.first
Recipe.last                             # In order of last updated, not in order of ID
Recipe.find_by(title: "Hand Sandwich")  # ID is a better way to look things up because duplicates.
Recipe.find_by(id: 2)                   # Note: Let rails do everything re: IDs, you will mess things up if you try and define or change them yourself.
Recipe.find(2)    						# Shortcut to look up Recipe of id = 2. There's a shortcut because looking something up by id is so common.
recipe.update(prep_time: 400)           # AVOID: Updates the database without having to save again. For some reason, avoiding using this will give us more flexibility later.
```

**Note** Josh keeps redefining the variable recipe every time he accesses data. This is because, since it's a database, you want to referesh it frequently in case youâ€”-or anytone else--has changed the data.

How to update an entry without using .update:

```ruby
recipe = Recipe.find(3)
recipe.ingredients = "cookie mix. milk. eggs. love"
recipe.save
```

### Setting Up the Rest of the App

In `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/one_recipe_url" => 'api/recipes#one_recipe_action'
end
```
In `app/controllers/api/recipies_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class Api::RecipesController < ApplicationController
  def one_recipe_action
    @recipe = Recipe.last
    render 'one_recipe_view.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

In `app/views/api/recipies/one_recipe_view.json.jbuilder`:

```
json.id @recipe.id
json.title @recipe.title
json.chef @recipe.chef
json.prep_time @recipe.prep_time
json.ingredients @recipe.ingredients
json.directions @recipe.directions
```

New **best practice** for urls:

In `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    get "/one_recipe_url" => 'recipes#one_recipe_action'
  end
end
```

This is the equivalent of writing `get "/api/one_recipe_url" => 'api/recipes#one_recipe_action'`. This is a very common convention. Makes the route more clear.

Now, to access the site on your server, you'll need to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/one_recipe_url`.

* Note: 
  * The Cookbook App is going to be our in-class demo. If yours isn't working, don't stress or sacrifice class time getting it running. You can download Josh's working version.
  * Contacts App. Work harder to keep this one working and up to do.
  * Mini capstone.

## Exercise: Create a Contacts App

Note that since I'm following along with Josh, this is slightly different from the version saved on my local drive.

```bash
### Create brand new Rails app to store contacts
rails new contact_app
cd contact_app
rake db:create
rails generate controller api/recipes   
### Create a model called Contact that stores first names, last names, emails, and phone numbers
rails generate model Contact first_name:string last_name:string email:string phone_number:string
### Take a second to check your migration file, to see if everything looks good. DO NOT TOUCH the migration file once you actually migrate it (next step).
rake db:migrate
rails console
```
```ruby
### Adding 3 contacts to rails console
contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Joe", last_name: "Dirt", email: "joe.dirt@gmail.com", phone_number: "801-555-1234")
contact.save
### Adding second contact
contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Sara", last_name: "Jane", email: "mr.smith@whovian.uk", phone_number: "212-987-5551")
contact.save
### Third contact
contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Groucho", last_name: "Marx", email: "groucho.marx@gmail.com", phone_number: "310-234-5551")
contact.save
Contact.all                         # Shows us that we have 3 contacts
Contact.first                       # Shows us Joe Dirt
Contact.email = "dirt@walmart.com"  # Changes Joe Dirt's e-mail
### Things aren't going to go well for our next Contact
contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Sacrificial", last_name: "Lamb", email: "byebye@yahoo.com", phone_number: "666-666-6666")
contact.save
### Terminating our last contact
contact = Contact.last      # Finds the contact that was last updated.
contact.destroy
###
contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Billy", last_name: "Thornton", email: "blood@necklace.net", phone_number: "818.555.0012")
contact.save
### Note here that the contact id is now 5. There is no longer an id 4.
Contact.find(4)
#### Error. Record not found.
exit
```

In `/config/routes.db`:

```Ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do 
    get "/one_contact" => 'contacts#first_contact'
  end
end
```
In `app/controllers/api/contacts_controller.rb`

```ruby
class Api::ContactsController < ApplicationController
  def first_contact
    @contact = Contact.first
    render 'contact.json.jbuilder'
  end
end
```

In `app/views/api/contacts/contact.json.jbuilder`

```
json.id @contact.id
json.first_name @contact.first_name
json.last_name @contact.last_name
json.email @contact.email
json.phone_number @contact.phone_number
```

### Rails follows an MVC design pattern.

__Get Josh's powerpoint for this__

Each of these have a specific function:

Model
View
Controller

1. Model 

Defines how we interact with stored information. In rails, we use an ORM (object relation mapping tool) to interact, store, or model our data. ORM = ActiveRecord. Tables are stored in database, classes are stored in models folder.

View = Interface

Controller = Logic Flow
