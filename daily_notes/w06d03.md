# Welcome to mooooooore coding.

There are no symbols in Javascript.

### Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2} Someone just bought two chairs. Change the hash such that the chair amount is 3. The final result should be: {chair: 3, table: 2}, first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
funiture_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
funiture_amounts[:chair] = 3
p funiture_amounts
```

```js
var funitureAmounts = {chair: 5, table: 2};
// All of these work:
// funitureAmounts["chair"] = 3;
// funitureAmounts["chair"] -= 2;
funitureAmounts.chair = 3;
console.log(funitureAmounts);
```

The `.chair` syntax is kind of a built-in reader and writer method that JS already has in pace. If you call a reader method for a that doesn't exist, you'll get `undefined` returned. It's one of seven falsey values in JS. Some others are: `NaN`, `0`, `null`, `false`, `""` (empty strings).

### Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2} You received 7 desks to sell. Change the hash to include desks. The final result should be: {chair: 5, table: 2, desk: 7}, first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
item_amounts[desk] = 7
p item_amounts
```

```js
item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2};
item_amounts.desk = 7;
console.log(item_amounts.desk);
```

### Write a method that accepts a number and returns its factorial. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120., first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
def factorial(number)
  product = 1
  while number > 0
    product *= number
    number -= 1
  end
product
end
```

```js
function factorial(number) {
  var product = 1;
  while (number > 0) {
    product *= number;
    number--;
  }
  return product;
}
console.log(factorial(5));
```

 ### Write a method that accepts two arrays of numbers, and prints the sum of every combination of numbers from first and second array.  For example, if the method receives [1, 5, 10] and [100, 500, 1000], the method should print a list: 101, 501, 1001, 105, 505, 1005, 110, 510, 1010., first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
def all_combinations(numbers_1, numbers_2)
  combos = []
  numbers_1.each do |number_1|
    numbers_2.each do |number_2|
      combos << number_1 + number_2
    end
  end
  combos
end
```

```js
function allCombinations(numbers_1, numbers_2) {
  var combos = [];
  numbers_1.forEach( function(number_1) {
    numbers_2.forEach( function(number_2) {
      combos.push(number_1 + number_2)
    });
  });
  return combos
}
```


## Translating from JS to Ruby
See Josh's cheat sheet.

`$ node` is the JS equivalent of `$ irb`. You can quit out of node by typing `.exit`. 

Javascript handles random numbers differently. The function you use is `Math.random();`, which generates a random numbers between 0 and 1. So, for example

* To get the numbers 1â€“10, execute `Math.random() * 10 + 1;`. If you want the integers, round the numbers using `Math.floor`, like so: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);` 

## For Loops in Javascript

For loops are very similar to a while loop. First, check out the while looop in JS:

```js
var i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

Now check out some code with the same functionality in a for loop:

```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

```

Note that `var i = 0` runs once before the loop begins, and the `i++` runs once each time at the end of the loop. 

## In-class exercise: Convert Ruby to Javascript
Ruby:

```ruby 
# Equality check
x = 10
if x == "10"
  puts "equal"
else
  puts "not equal"
end
```
Javascript:

```js
var x = 10;
if ( x === "10") {
  console.log("equal");
} else {
  console.log("not equal");
}
```

Ruby:

```ruby 
# Falsey values
x = 3
if nil
  x = x + 1
end
if false
  x = x + 1
end
if 0
  x = x + 1
end
if !!""
  x = x + 1
end
p x
```

Javascript:

```js
var x = 3; 
if (null) {
  x++;
}
if (false) {
  x++;
}
if (0) {
  x++;
}
if (!!"") {
  x++;
}
console.log(x);
```

Ruby

```ruby
# Functions
def print_lyrics
  puts "Now this is a story all about how"
  puts "My life got flipped turned upside down"
  puts "And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there"
  puts "I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air"
end

print_lyrics```

Javascript:

```js
function printLyrics() {
  console.log("Now this is a story all about how");
  console.log("My life got flipped turned upside down");
  console.log("And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there");
  console.log("I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air");
}
printLyrics();
```

Ruby:

```ruby
# Scope
x = 100
def add_one(num)
  x = 1
  return num + x
end
puts x           #=> 100
puts add_one(5)  #=> 6
puts x           #=> 100
```

Javascript:

```js
var x = 100;
def addOne(num) {
  x = 1;
  return num + 1;
}
console.log(x);
console.log(addOne(5));
console.log(x);
```

This is an important distinction. In Javascript, where you define a variable determines what scope it has. If you define it outside of the function, it's an "outside-the-function" variable. It's accessible inside of the function, where it's the same x. So when you redefine it in the function, it redefines it at the top-level as well. BUT we can change this scope!

```js
var x = 100;
def addOne(num) {
  var x = 1;
  return num + 1;
}
console.log(x);
console.log(addOne(5));
console.log(x);
```

By adding `var` to `x = 1;`, you now created a new variable inside the function, which is only in that scope, not the top-level scope. So if we run it again, we'll get the same result as ruby. It doesn't affect the top-level definition of `var x = 100`. This is very similar to an instance method in ruby, allowing us to access the variable in a different scope.

Ruby:

```ruby
# JavaScript objects vs. Ruby classes
class Boat
  attr_reader :name, :color
  attr_writer :color

  def initialize(name, color, price)
    @name = name
    @color = color
    @price = price
  end

  def color=(new_color)
    @color = new_color
  end
end

boat = Boat.new("S. S. Minnow", "white", 20000 )
p boat
p boat.name
boat.color = "red"
p boat.color
```

Javascript:

```js
```
