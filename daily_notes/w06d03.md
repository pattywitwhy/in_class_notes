### Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2} Someone just bought two chairs. Change the hash such that the chair amount is 3. The final result should be: {chair: 3, table: 2}, first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
funiture_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
funiture_amounts[:chair] = 3
p funiture_amounts
```

```js

### Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2} You received 7 desks to sell. Change the hash to include desks. The final result should be: {chair: 5, table: 2, desk: 7}, first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

### Write a method that accepts a number and returns its factorial. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120., first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
```

```js
```

 ### Write a method that accepts two arrays of numbers, and prints the sum of every combination of numbers from first and second array.  For example, if the method receives [1, 5, 10] and [100, 500, 1000], the method should print a list: 101, 501, 1001, 105, 505, 1005, 110, 510, 1010., first in Ruby, then in Javascript.

```ruby
