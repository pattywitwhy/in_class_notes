# Day man. Aaaaaah!

## In-class example: Mini-capstone

**Exercise:** 

#### Change your mini_capstone so there can be multiple images, instead of just one. (This will take multiple steps!) You will need to remove the image_url attribute from the Product model and create an entirely new Image model to do this. Use `url` as the image attribute to get this to work seamlessly with the mini-capstone front end.

**Steps:**
* Create an Image model. 
  * Url is the name of the image attribute.
  * product_id is the attribute to document my association
* Move image_url and product's id to the Image table, creating image instances/rows
* Remove image_url attribute from the Product model
* Place information into my Image model
* Create the association methods to connect products and images
  * a Product#images - has_many images
  * a Image#product - belongs_to product

```bash 
rails c 
Product.pluck(:id, :image_url)
image_data.each { |data| p data }
exit

```

In `db.seed`. Make sure we have the most up-to-data data from our previous dump.

```bash
rake db:seed:dump

rails g model Image url:string product_id:integer
```

Check db > migrate > last migration file to make sure everything looks good

```bash
rake db:seed:dump

rails g model Image url:string product_id:integer
rails c 
image_data = Product.pluck(:id, :image_url)
image_data.each { |data| Image.create(product_id: data[0], url: data[1]) }

# ### More reader friendly way to do this:
# products = Product.all
# products.each { |product| Image.create(product_id: product.id, url: product.image_url) }

exit

rails g migration RemoveImageUrlFromProducts image_url:string

# Check the migration file to make sure it looks good

rake db:migrate

```

Here's the **long way** to do the next steps:

In the product.rb model

```ruby
def images
  Image.where(product_id: self.id)
end
```

In the image.rb model
```ruby
def product
  Product.find_by(id: self.product)
end
```

Now we've connected images and products. 

```bash
rails c 
product = Product.first
# Note there is no more image url now. But, the product still has images associated with it.
product.images
# This shows us all images with this product's id associated with it.


```

#### Change your json view to show all images with each product.

Remove this line:

```ruby
json.image_url product.image_url
```

Add this:

```ruby
json.images do
  #image partial array
end
```

Let's create a controller so we can set up a partial views for it

```bash
rails generate controller api/images

# If you messed up the controller:
# rails d controller images
# Then redo it with api/images
```

Create a partial called `_image.json.jbuilder`

```ruby
json.id image.id
json.url image.url

```

In the `_product` partial, edit the following in:

```ruby
json.images do
  json.array! product.images, partial: 'api/images/image', as: :image
end
```

```bash
rails s 
```

Open `https://localhost:3000/api/products`, and TA DA. You've got it.

#### Bonus: Fix your product create and update actions! (They are broken because you changed how images are savedâ€¦)

Go to your products controller, and delete this from create:

```ruby
image_url: params[:image_url]                                    # From the create method
@product.image_url = params[:image_url] || @product.image_url    # From the update method
```

```bash
rails c
Image.create(url: a_url, product_id: 3)     # Creates a new image url associated with product id 3
Image.create(url: another_url, product_3)   # 
```

**Let's do a shortcut now. It's a lot easier**

Open the `image.rb` model

```ruby
belongs_to :product
# (and delete the product method)
```

Open the `supplier.rb` model

Delete the products definition, and add the following

```ruby
has_many :products
```

Then on to the `products.rb` model. Remove the images and supplier definitions, and add the following

```ruby
belongs_to :supplier
belongs_to :images        # I'm almost positive this is wrong. Should be has_many, correct?
```

This provides us with more functionality below-the-hood than the long way, and is... you know, short.

#### Bonus: Make it so a user can create new images for a given product.


## Security

In the cookbook app

In your gemfile, uncomment out this line:

```ruby
gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'
```

Then bundle

```bash
bundle
rails g model User name email password_digest
rake db:migrate
rails g controller api/users
```

To `routes.rb`, add the post

```ruby
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    post '/users' => 'users#create'
    get "/recipes" => 'recipes#index'
    post "/recipes" => 'recipes#create'
    get "/recipes/:id" => 'recipes#show'
    patch "/recipes/:id" => 'recipes#update'
    delete "/recipes/:id" => 'recipes#destroy'
  end
```

In the users_controller.rb

```ruby
class Api::UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = User.new(
                    name: params[:name],
                    email: params[:email],
                    password: params[:password],
                    password_confirmation: params[:password_confirmation]
                    )
            
  end
end
```
In app > models > user.rb

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_secure_password       # This is written out in the gemfile if you forget the name 
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
end
```

In Insomnia, make a post request for

```
name: Joe Cool
email: joe@cool.com
password: password
password_confirmation: password
```

And my user was created successfully.

# I did this in the cookbook app, 

```ruby
```

```bash
```
